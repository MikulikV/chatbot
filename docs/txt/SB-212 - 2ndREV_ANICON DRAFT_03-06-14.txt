CBN APPROVED TAKEAWAY: Jesus (or just a loving father) is 
always ready to forgive 
“I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in 
heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine 
just persons who need no repentance.”
SYNOPSIS:
Chris' friend, Aaron is about to run away from home 
because he thinks he's done something so bad his father 
will never forgive him.  As Chris, Joy and Gizmo struggle 
with how to help their friend, Superbook whisks them away 
to Galilee, where Jesus is telling a crowd the parable of 
the Prodigal Son.  During their time with Jesus, the kids 
learn a valuable lesson about the power of forgiveness 
and the unfailing love of a father.  They return home and 
are now able to encourage Aaron to face up to what he's 
done and ask for his father's forgiveness, instead of 
running away.

FADE IN:
EXT. GALILEE AREA - MEETING PLACE - DAY - (POSSIBLE REUSE  
#110) 
(Luke 15: 1-7) A CROWD (ALL NT REUSE) - some standing - 
some seated.  
TWO CHILDREN (NT REUSE) run by - GIGGLING - playing.   
2 CHILDREN
1
(GIGGLING)
At the rear of the crowd - CAMERA FINDS PHARISEE #1 - and 
PHARISEE #2 standing beneath an olive tree, looking O.C. 
with intensity.  SCRIBE #1 and SCRIBE #2 are with them, 
scrutinizing the crowd.  
PHARISEE #1
2
Hmghh.. What is it they see in 
Jesus?  
PHARISEE #2
3
He forgives everyone. - keeps 
company with sinners.  See the tax 
collectors.
THEIR POV - JESUS (REUSE) is prominent in a casually 
seated group consisting of His 12 DISCIPLES (REUSE). 
There is a tree for shade and a meal spread on a rock.  
TAX COLLECTOR #1, TAX COLLECTOR #2, SINNER #1, SINNER #2 
(PLEASE CHECK WITH ERIN TO SEE IF THERE ARE NT MODELS 
THAT WILL PASS FOR THESE) are seated closest to Jesus.  
They share bread - pass a wine skin.  Just outside their 
circle is SHEPHERD BOY MICAH(14) (NEW), with a small herd 
of sheep on the BG hill. He stands, leaning on his staff 
watching Jesus closely.
 PHARISEE #1 AND #2

(low derisive chuckles)
PHARISEE #1 (O.C.)

And we know they need forgiveness.
BACK ON THE FOUR - as they all snicker in agreement.
PHARISEES/SCRIBES

(low righteous snickers)
Scribe #1 leans in to Pharisee #1 
SCRIBE #1
7
Notice - the crowds that follow 
him keep growing. 
A beat - Pharisee #1 sharply EXITS FRAME. Pharisee #2 
smiles slyly - pridefully - and exits after him with the 
others. 
ANGLE ON MICAH AND HIS FLOCK 
Peter and John - humorously approach the Shepherd Boy.
PETER
8
Excuse me.  Are those your sheep?
PUSH IN ON MICAH
MICAH
9
Yes.  I am tending these  Myself. 
And this is just a part of my 
family’s herd!  My father put me 
in charge.
He spins the bo and accidentally hits himself in the 
head. 
MICAH
10
Offf... uh... (throat clear) - Me!
BACK ON PETER AND JOHN
PETER/JOHN
11
(can’t hold in the gentle laugh 
any longer)
JOHN
12
Well, if your father trusts you 
with all of them...
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  2.
 PETER
13
... I’d say, you might want to go 
after that run-away. 
Peter points - <BAAAA-SFX> - The Boy whirls to look.
POV - A SHEEP is darting and weaving away from the herd.
MICAH (O.C.)
14
Huh?  Oh no!  Come back! 
He dashes into the POV SHOT and races after the sheep. 
This SHEEP has a visibly defining brown patch behind one 
ear - for later identification. 
ON JESUS - Peter and John move back to the circle as they 
all watch the O.C. Shepherd Boy and cheer him on.
DISCIPLES/FOLLOWERS
15
(laughter) 
The laughter/distraction fades as “THE FOUR” step up.
PHARISEE #1
16
 Are you Jesus of Nazareth?
Jesus turns.  
JESUS
17
I am.
The others watch - a bit surprised at the strong tone 
from the Pharisee.
PHARISEE #1
18
They call you a teacher.
CLOSE ON JESUS
SCRIBE #1 (O.C)
19
And a prophet.
Jesus looks at him and before he can answer...
ON PHARISEES
PHARISEE #1
20
Yet, you dine with sinners and tax 
collectors.  The leaders of the 
Temple are asking how you would 
explain that, “teacher.” 
FAVOR JESUS 
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  3.
 He turns and looks off towards the hillside. 
MICAH
21
(distant)
Stop!  Rebel! You cannot leave the 
flock!  Come back here.
JESUS’ POV - The young Shepherd is scurrying along, using 
his staff to herd the one recalcitrant sheep back towards 
several other sheep. <BLEATING SFX>
CLOSE ON JESUS - continuing to look off.
JESUS (CEV Luke 15: 1-7)
22
If any of you has a hundred sheep, 
and one of them gets lost, what 
will you do?  
Jesus turns back to the Pharisees.  ANGLE WIDENS to 
include them.
JESUS
23
Won't you leave the ninety-nine in 
the field and go look for the lost 
sheep until you find it? 
ON THE FOUR - They listen skeptically, not understanding 
where this is leading.
TRACKING SHEPHERD BOY AND SHEEP - The sheep darts sharply 
and dashes through the THREE CROWD MEMBERS (the same ones 
who arrived past the Pharisees earlier) who are now 
seated just beyond Jesus’ inner circle. <BLEATING SFX>
LOW - CLOSE ON THE SHEEP RUNNING straight up to Jesus’ 
feet.  
WIDEN AS Jesus picks up the lamb and continues…
JESUS (CEV)
24
And when you find it, you will be 
so glad that you will put it on 
your shoulder and carry it home. 
Jesus puts the sheep around the Shepherd Boy’s shoulders.  
CROWD MEMBERS/DISCIPLES(O.C.)
25
(low walla/appreciation)
CLOSE ON THE SHEPHERD BOY AND HIS SHEEP - The Disciples’ 
hands reach INTO FRAME offering congratulatory pats on 
the boy’s shoulder and to his sheep. He beams happily... 
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  4.
 JESUS (O.C.) (CEV)
26
Then you will call in your friends 
and neighbors and say, "Let's 
celebrate! I've found my lost 
sheep."  
FAVOR JESUS - He looks to the Pharisees and Scribes - 
JESUS (CEV)
27
In the same way there is more 
happiness in heaven because of one 
sinner who turns to God than over 
ninety-nine good people who don't 
need to. 
The Pharisees look steely-eyed and but don't reply.
ON JESUS - PUSH IN...

TRACKING SHOT - Aaron run while struggling to pull a 
pricker branch stuck on his backside.  He gets it off and 
tosses it aside on the run. He passes Chris, Joy and 
Gizmo.
AARON
37
Uh, guys, didn’t see me! 
He looks back with dread as he races up the tree house 
stairs.
CAMERA RISES STRAIGHT UP FROM GROUND LEVEL - Carrying

Whoa, did you see that?!
JOY

What is up with Aaron?!
GIZMO

Yes, he usually wears a hat.
Chris and Joy whip-glare at Gizmo.
GIZMO

(defensively)
Wha-at. He does!
EXT. TREE HOUSE - CLOSE ON DOOR - SECONDS LATER
Chris’ hand tries to push the door open. It’s doesn’t 
budge. WIDEN OUT to include Chris, Joy and Gizmo as...
CHRIS
42
(push effort) - Aaron. Open up.
AARON (O.C.)
43
Is my father with you?   
CHRIS
44
No.  Why would your father be...
Before he can finish his sentence the door opens just far 
enough for Aaron’s arm to reach out - in cartoon-style-
rapid-fire-succession the arm yanks Chris inside with a 
<WHIP-WHOOSH SFX> - 
CHRIS
45
Whoaaaa....
Then it whips back out and yanks Joy in <WHIP-WHOOSH SFX>

INT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Aaron leans with his back to the door, arms spread.  The 
kids stare at him.  Gizmo has both hands on his own head 
and work to turn his head around and get it back in 
place.  He does this as...
CHRIS
49
Aaron, why are you hiding from 
your father?
AARON 
50
I did something really bad, Chris! 
CLOSE ON Aaron
AARON
51
I’m going to be in so, so much 
trouble.  My dad’ll never forgive 
me! 
Aaron zips over to the periscope and yanks it down - 
peering through and rotating it, looking to see if his 
dad is following, as he is saying...
AARON (CONT’D)
52
I can never go home again.  
WIDER ANGLE - Chris, Joy and Gizmo stare at Aaron in 
surprise.
JOY
53
What did you do? 
Aaron whips the periscope shut.
AARON
54
Chris, how much to rent out your 
tree house. (noticing) - Lotta 
carpet -(back on it)  Starting... 
say... now.
CHRIS
55
Aaron, you can’t live in my tree 
house!
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  8.
 AARON
56
It’s either that or I got to find 
an apartment across town.  Look, 
I’ve got birthday money.  I’ll pay 
you ten dollars a week.
JOY
57
This is crazy!
GIZMO
58
Yes!  The periscope and bean bag 
chair alone make it worth twenty. 
Chris and Joy shoot Gizmo a look.  He gives a “What did I 
say?” expression.
GIZMO
59
(low)
I am trying to negotiate here.
Aaron keeps up the tempo - pacing.
AARON
60
All right. All right!  Fine!  My 
dad would probably figure out I’m 
living here anyway.
He pulls out a piece of wrinkled note paper.
AARON
61
Here’s a list of things I’m gonna 
need on the road. - I’m running 
away. 
FAVOR CHRIS JOY AND GIZMO - The stare from Aaron, to the 
list and then at one another.
AARON
62
Oh, and the ten peanut butter 
sandwiches - can you trim off the 
crust the way my dad does?  I 
really like ‘em like that.   
CHRIS
63
Ok---ay... ah... Aaron, do not 
leave the tree house.  Understand 
me?  Do NOT leave the tree house.  
Chris, Joy and Gizmo get out and shut the door.  Aaron 
slumps down in the bean bag chair - a beat - he considers 
it.

AARON (O.C.)
64
Nice chair!  I’ll go 15 a week. 
Not a penny more.
CHRIS
65
What are we going to do?
GIZMO
66
He likes the chair.  I say we go 
in for the kill, nineteen bucks  a 
month.  No ups no extras.
JOY
67
Or we could try to convince him to 
go home and face up to this thing.  
PUSH IN ON CHRIS
CHRIS
68
I don’t know. Aaron been my friend 
a long time.  If he says he can’t 
tell his dad... then, maybe what 
he did... really is unforgiveable.  
SLOWLY PAN FROM CHRIS, TO JOY AND THEN TO GIZMO as they 
grapple with this.  Suddenly the SUPERBOOK FX comes up.  
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO

SUPERBOOK!
The effect envelops them and they rise into the book.

Oh no!  We cannot go. We must stay

TREE where we first met the Pharisees.

Micah stops the lamb from fleeing and turns to see the 
kids sitting up below the tree.  He looks up at the 
branches.

Ah, fall through the tree? Uh, 
yes.
GIZMO

Weak branches. (giggle)
The kids start to rise as...
JOY
77
Sorry.  Did we startle your sheep?
The Boy gets up and holds the tether.  The sheep 
continues to pull tightly and the boy pulls back.
MICAH
78
(efforts) No.  This sheep has a 
mind of his own.  Calm down.  
JOY

I’m Joy.  This is Chris and Gizmo.
MICAH

Were you up in the tree trying to 
get a better view of Jesus?
JOY
82
Jesus?
Micah points to Jesus and thr crowd.
MICAH
83
Yes, He is the reason there are so 
many people gathered here today.  
Jesus is a great teacher.  I 
especially like it when he tells 
parables.
ON JOY AND GIZMO
JOY
84
What’s a parable?
Gizmo shoots a forefinger in the air.
GIZMO
85
Oh!  A parable is short story 
which uses familiar events to 
illustrate a religious or ethical 
point. 
MICAH 
86
You have heard Jesus speak then?!
GIZMO
87
No. My internal data frame is 
equipped with high capacity 
quantum memory.

What?

Joy quickly covers Gizmo’s mouth.

Chris takes a piece but doesn;t eat it.

To those who listen to my 
teaching, more understanding will

father...

Father... I want my share of your

The older turns and exits in a huff.  
The father turns back to the younger son - puts his hands 
on both his shoulders - considers him for a beat.
JESUS (V.O.)

So his father agreed to divide his 
wealth between his sons...
LATER
The son heads down the road with his belongings.  The 
father waves goodbye through tears.
EXT. HIGH SEAS - BEAUTY SHOT - DAY
A ship sails the sea. The Prodigal son is at the bow.

A few days later this younger son 
packed all his belongings and

living.

 The Dancing Girl pull shim to his feet.  She indicates  
she wants more of his money.  He tips his money pouch.  
It’s empty. He leans to kiss her.  She smacks his face

without the money to pay, he simply steals one and walks 
off drinking from it.  The Vendor spots him.  
VENDOR 2 (O.C.)

he slumps to the ground and they throw his wine sckin in 
his face.

JESUS (V.O.)

The young man became so hungry 
that even the pods he was feeding 
the pigs looked good to him. But 
no one gave him anything.
He seems wrenched in pain as he slowly reaches down and 
lifts a handful of dirt mixed with pig food.  The 
mixtures spills out between his fingers as he consider it 
but doesn’t raise it closer.  Tears begin to roll down 
his cheek.  His hand begins to tremble.  His chin drops

Jesus is no longer standing and speaking.  He’s sitting, 
talking quietly with his Disciples.  The crowd has 
thinned.

Wow.  That was a short story.

He perks up - know-it all...

So, when we chased off after 
Rebel, the son had wasted all his 
money and was working feeding the 
pigs.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO/MICAH
202
Yes!/What Happened after that? Did 
he die of starvation?/ He couldn’t 
go home again, that would be, 
statistically, his worst 
choice/So, what did he do?/ I bet 
he wished he had never taken the 
money!

job of feeding the pigs...
DISSOLVE INTO THE STORY....
The pigs <EAT RAVENOUSLY>. 
CLOSE ON THE PRODIGAL SON - starving.  He looks into to 
the now empty jar of pods and tosses it aside.  Then he 
looks down at the pigs and slowly drops to his knees.
JESUS (V.O.)
205
The young man became so hungry 
that even the pods he was feeding 
the pigs looked good to him. But 
no one gave him anything.
He seems wrenched in pain as he slowly reaches down and 
lifts a handful of dirt mixed with pig food.  The 
mixtures spills out between his fingers as he consider it 
but doesn’t raise it closer.  Tears begin to roll down 
his cheek.  His hand begins to tremble.  His chin drops 
to his chest and he sobs uncontrollably.

 PRODIGAL SON
206
(sobbing)
JESUS (V.O.)
207
Finally, he came to his senses and 
said... 
The Son looks up... still holding the fist squeezing pig 
food between the fingers.
PRODIGAL SON
208
My father's workers have plenty to 
eat, and here I am, starving to 
death!  I will go to my father and 
say to him, `Father, I have sinned 
against God in heaven and against 
you. I am no longer good enough to 
be called your son. Treat me like 
one of your workers.
EXT. ROAD LEADING TO PS COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY
The father sees his son coming in the distance.  The son 
looks haggard, hungry and disheveled - stumbling as he 
walks.
JESUS (V.O.)
209
But when he was still a long way 
off, his father saw him and felt 
sorry for him. - 
The father’s eyes soften - a tear of joy appears in the 
corner of his eye. 
FATHER
210
(gasp
 He wipes it away and exits quickly towards his son.
FATHER
211
(running efforts)
MUSIC GROWS - The father RUNS - (Biblically significant 
that he is running) - towards the son.  
JESUS (V.O.)
212
He ran to his son... 
The son collapses just as the father RUNS into frame and 
catches him in his arms.  The father goes down to his 
knees, holding him.  He hugs him tightly and strokes his 
head.
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  30.
 JESUS
213
... and (he) hugged and kissed 
him.
The father simply holds him tighter and cries. 
THE MUSIC SWELLS - 
CAMERA PULLS BACK - We see the Older Brother watching 
from the field where he is working with an ox and plow.  
He cracks the whips and drives the ox away from the sight 
of his brother.
INT. PRODIGAL SON HOUSE - DAY
The Father brings the son in and calls to his servant. 
FATHER
214
Hurry and bring the best clothes 
and put them on him.  Give him a 
ring for his finger and sandals 
for his feet.  Get the best calf 
and prepare it, so we can eat and 
celebrate.  This son of mine was 
dead, but has now come back to 
life.  He was lost and has now 
been found. 
JESUS (V.O.)
215
And they began to celebrate.
EXT. PRODIGAL SON COUNTRY HOUSE - SUNSET
<MUSIC> comes form inside.  The older brother approaches. 
Through the open door he can see sees the SILHOUETTES of 
people dancing and partying.
JESUS (V.O.)
216
The older son had been out in the 
field. But when he came near the 
house, he heard the music and 
dancing. 
He waves the servant at the door over.
OLDER SON
217
What's going on here?
SERVANT
218
Your brother has come home safe 
and sound, and your father ordered 
us to kill the best calf.
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  31.
 JESUS (V.O.)
219
The older brother got so angry 
that he would not even go into the 
house.
The brother turns and kicks a nearby pile of baskets.  
OLDER SON
220
(Kick effort)
It <SMASHES> against the side of the house.  The Father 
comes out to see what the commotion is.  He goes to his 
older son and tries to reason with him - encouraging him 
to go into the house.
JESUS
221
His father came out and begged him 
to go in. 
CLOSE ON THE OLDER SON as he whirls towards his father.
OLDER SON

(effort)
OLDER SON
223
For years I have worked for you 
like a slave and have always 
obeyed you. 
ANGLE ADJUSTS - To include the Father as the son rails at 
him.
OLDER SON
224
But you have never even given me a 
little goat, so that I could give 
a dinner for my friends.  
He points accusingly into the house...
OLDER SON
225
This other son of yours wasted 
your money. And now that he has 
come home, you ordered the best 
calf to be killed for a feast. 
(effort)
He is emotionally spent and slowly collapses down into a 
sitting position with his back against the wall of the 
house.
FAVOR THE FATHER
SB #212 "The Prodigal Son" - Roche - REV Anicon Draft 3-6-14  32.
 His expression slowly goes from shock at his son’s 
outburst - to calm - to sadness - and then to loving 
resolve...
FATHER
226
My son, you are always with me, 
and everything I have is yours. 
But we should be glad and 
celebrate! Your brother was dead, 
but he is now alive. He was lost 
and has now been found. 
DISSOLVE OUT OF THE STORY:

Yes.  He was welcomed home with 
open arms and his father just gave 
him more.

230
That is love.
He rises.
JESUS

bigger than that stuff.
JOY

Fathers forgive.
Aaron slumps down.
AARON
257
(Sigh of defeat) - My run-away 
plans are pretty lame aren’t they?
He rises and takes a deep breath.
AARON
258
Yeah... I better go home and face

Chris and Joy smile and nod as they turn and walk him 
towards the door. (They are ahead of Aaron)
