FADE IN:
EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - TROPICAL RAIN FOREST - PRESENT DAY 
POV THROUGH THE LENS OF A NEWS CAMERA PANNING a small 
OPERATION BLESSING style relief station:  4 or 5 small 
TENTS; folding TABLES. Supplies.(DESIGN: Use O.B. Logos)
TV NEWSWOMAN (O.S.)

This is Carol Cooper, Action News, 
coming to you from the site of the 
massive flood that has devastated 
the coast of this small nation. 
PAN PASSES a SUPPLY TRUCK with CHRIS, JOY and GIZMO 
unloading CARTONS from the back...
TV NEWSWOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
18
Donations of food and medical 
supplies continue to pour in. 
PAN PASSES 8-10 LOCALS needing aid. They are lined up at 
one of the tents in a queue that ends O.S. so we can’t 
tell how many more there might be.    
TV NEWSWOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
19
And concerned people are flying in 
from everywhere to help…
PHOEBE leans out of a tent and gently ushers in the next 
person waiting in line.
TV NEWSWOMAN (CONT’D)
20
... including a gentleman we’ve 
just met, Professor Quantum.
END PAN on the safari-jacketed TV NEWSWOMAN, standing 
next to PROFESSOR QUANTUM.  Quantum proudly waves off to 
Chris and Gizmo unloading the truck in the B.G.  Beside 
him is a HIGH-TECH FILTRATION SYSTEM, consisting of 
canisters, pumps, tubing which runs to an adjacent WELL. 
It is all powered by an array of small solar panels.
TV NEWSWOMAN (CONT’D)
21
(points to gadgetry)
Professor?  Can you tell us what 
you've brought with you?
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
22
That’s my family. And our friend 
Joy. They insisted on coming to 
help.
JOY
23
(swatting flies)
Ohhhhh...
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   3
 TV NEWSWOMAN
24
Actually, Professor, I was 
referring to this. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
25
Oh. This! (CLEARING THROAT) Well, 
yes. Well, as you know, a big 
problem after any flood is 
polluted drinking water. 
The Professor turn and gestures proudly to his device. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (CONT’D)
26
But my ultraviolet chloramine-
based purification system works 
deep in these wells to produce 
fresh clean water within hours! 
ANGLE ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK
Chris is in the truck bed stacking boxes in Gizmo’s arms.  
(Gizmo and Joy are on the ground.) Joy is tired and hot.
Joy <SMACKS> at a mosquito on her neck.
JOY
27
Ugh!  These mosquitoes are 
everywhere!  
GIZMO
28
Do not worry, Joy. I believe the 
snakes will eat most of them.
He turns and exits with the stack of boxes. Joy does a 
big “take.”
JOY
29
Ugh! Snakes?!!
Chris jumps off the bed of the truck with a <SPLAT> that 
sends a bit of mud flying up at Joy. 
CHRIS
30
If they don’t drown in all this 
mud.
Joy wipes the mud in disgruntled disgust.
JOY
31
Ugh! Chris!
ANGLE ON THE MEDICAL TENT
Phoebe sticks her head out of the tent.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
32
Joy, could you bring four more 
cases of sterile gauze? 
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   4
 FAVOR JOY 
She is trying to wipe off the mud. 
JOY
33
Uhh.. Right away Mrs. Quantum.
She grabs a stack of 4 boxes. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
34
Joy, would you please bring 
another case of antiseptic and 
more cotton swabs to tent three? 
Oh, and those suture kits.
JOY
35
I’ll be right there!
She starts to exit back towards the truck, frantically 
juggling her supplies while swatting at mosquitoes and 
stumbling through the weeds and mud.
JOY (CONT’D)
36
(Efforts)
OTHER SIDE OF THE TRUCK
She slips and falls beside the truck - out of sight of 
the others - dropping the boxes. (They do not open)  
JOY (CONT’D)
37
(Fall - impact - frustrated 
Agghh!)
She struggles to her feet, dripping mud.  Near tears, she 
leans against the cab of the truck. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (O.S.)
38
Joy, How’s it coming with the 
Gauze?
PHOEBE (O.S.)
39
Joy, Can you hurry with the Suture 
kits?
JOY
40
(small sobs)
Chris and Gizmo peek around the front of the truck.
CHRIS
41
Joy?
GIZMO
42
Your eyes are leaking.
She lets it all out as Chris and Giz move closer. 
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   5
 JOY
43
Oh, Giz, Chris, I just... I just 
can’t do this.  Any of it! 
She sits down on the truck cab’s running board. 
JOY (CONT’D)
44
I want to help. I really do.  I 
felt it in my heart the minute we 
heard about the trouble here. 
Gizmo and Chris sit on either side of her. Chris puts a 
hand on her shoulder in support as she goes on.
JOY (CONT’D)
45
But the bugs, and the mud and all 
of those people who need help... I 
just didn't think it would all be 
so… so hard.
Suddenly, the SUPERBOOK SFX comes up.  The kids react.
JOY/CHRIS/GIZMO
46
Superbook?!
Superbook rises from the bed of the truck.  It goes 
through its process and the kids are whisked away. 
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO

(Whoa... Here we go... Not 
again...)

 Paul and PRISONER 1, PRISONER 2 and PRISONER 3 are 
shackled with leg irons to one another.  They are herded

Bring them aboard.
CENTURION PORCIUS
52
You heard the captain. Move it 
along or you’ll get another taste 
of my whip!
POCIUS whips PAUL. PAUL moves forward in pain.
PORCIUS is <CRACKING> his whip threateningly IN THE AIR 
ABOVE. PORCIUS whips another prisoner.
ZOOM IN ON JULIUS. Julius glares sternly at Porcius 
whipping the prisoners.
Porcius whips an weakened prisoner to the ground.
CAPTAIN JULIUS
53
There is no need to strike them.  
CAPTAIN JULIUS touches Porcius’ arm. Shrugs the captain 
off in defiance and exits. Julius watches him carefully 
for a beat.

CENTURION PORCIUS (O.S.)
55
Halt!  What are you doing there?! 
Down to the hold with the rest of 
the prisoners.
The kids and Gizmo turn to see the snarling Centurion 
Porcius headed toward them as he <CRACKS> his whip.
CHRIS
56
Run!!!!
GIZMO
57
(screaming)
They take off on the run.
CENTURION PORCIUS
58
I’ll teach you to try to escape.
SAILOR (O.C.)

Escape! Three Prisoners escaped!
Porcius, the Hold Centurion and SAILOR 1 join in pursuit.

(CHASE WALLA) Grab‘em!/There they 
go!/Over here/Hurry ETC.
CLOSE ON CHRIS - The SHIP’S CAPTAIN (NOT CAPTAIN JULIUS)  
leaps out to block his way, but Chris grabs a hanging 
line and swings on it...
CHRIS
61
WHOAAAA... ooh, that’s better. 
(SCREAM)
ANGLE ON GIZMO - He scrambles across a rope.
GIZMO
62
(panicked sounds - fast breathing)
He climbs up the mainmast, SAILOR #1 is climbing after 
him. Gizmo reaches the top with nowhere left to go.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
63
It seems there is a flaw in this 
plan.
He hears JOY scream from below.
JOY
64
(Scream)
He loses his balance and falls off the mast.

 GIZMMO
65
Aaaaaaaahhhhh!
MS ON SAILOR 2 and SAILOR 3 approaching JOY.
GIZMO CRASHES into SAILOR 3 at the base, knocking him off 
screen right. CHRIS swings in from screen left, kicks 
SAILOR 2 over toward screen right, and knocks into JOY 
and GIZMO so that they are all in a pile and covering 
SAILOR 2.
SAILOR 2/SAILOR 3/CHRIS/JOY/GOZMO
66
Oooof!!/AGGGHH! (Efforts)
CU ON PORCIUS throwing a net on the trio.

67
Gotcha.
3S - The net lands on them.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
68
(Whoooaaa! Etc...)
PORCIUS
69
Heh-heh.
PORCIUS looks on smugly.
INT. SHIP’S HOLD - LATER
Chris, Gizmo and a dejected Joy are now seated on one of 
the benches, shackled to Paul.  Gizmo shifts 
uncomfortably.
GIZMO
70
Ugh. . . I think these leg irons 
are giving me a rash.
He reaches down, unscrews his leg at the knee, removes 
the shackle, scratches his leg, then puts the shackle and 
the leg back on.  
FAVOR PAUL, who watches Gizmo with surprise.
PAUL
71
Your friend is very unusual.
CHRIS
72
Oh yeah, he’s definitely one-of-a-
kind.  (noticing)  You okay, Joy?
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   9
 CLOSE ON JOY, LOOKING GLUM
JOY
73
Oh, Peachy. I went from mosquitoes 
and mud to chains and a prison 
ship.  (Sigh) My life just keeps 
getting better.
WIDEN - Chris shrugs helplessly, then turns back to Paul.
PUSH IN CLOSE as Paul tells his story.
PAUL
74
Joy, during the time I spent in 
prison I realized God’s power is 
strongest when I’m weak. 
CHRIS and GIZMO look on at PAUL.
PAUL (CONT’D)
75
So, if he keeps giving me his 
power, I will gladly brag about 
how weak I am.
PAUL (CONT’D)
76
Yes, I am glad to be weak or 
insulted or mistreated, or to have 
troubles and sufferings. . . If it 
is for Christ. Because when I am 
weak, I am strong.
Joy glances at Paul then looks down defeated.
PAUL (CONT’D)
77
We should all pray for smooth 
passage to Rome.
GIZMO
78
Rome?  We are going to Rome?!  Oh, 
how exciting.
Paul breaks off a piece of bread.
PAUL
79
I am on my way to stand trial 
before Caesar.
JOY
80
You sound almost happy about that. 
CHRIS
81
Stand trial for what?
PAUL
82
Well, causing a disturbance.  It 
was in Jerusalem. 
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   10
(MORE)
 I was preaching about Jesus to 
whomever would listen...
RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:
FLASHBACK - EXT. TEMPLE COURTYARD (RE-USE FROM TEASER)
We see an excerpt from the opening teaser (re-use). Paul, 
surrounded by an angry mob, is taken away by Centurions. 
HIGHLIGHT THE PRIESTS watching him dragged off.
PAUL (V.O.)
83
I was accused of bringing a non-
believer into the Temple.  
CLOSE ON THE TEMPLE PRIEST - glowering.
PAUL (V.O.)
84
It wasn’t true. - They demanded 
the Romans put me to death, but of 
course they could never prove 
their charges. 
FLASHBACK - INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
Paul sits in his cell, bent over, his head in his hands.
PAUL (V.O.)
85
Several nights later Jesus 
appeared to me in my cell. 
Suddenly a bright white light shines on him. He looks up.
REVERSE ANGLE
JESUS stands before Paul.
JESUS (NKJV ACTS 23:11)
86
Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you 
have testified for me in 
Jerusalem, so you must also bear 
witness at Rome.
RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:
BACK TO PRESENT - INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
PAUL
87
Since then, my case has been heard 
before two Roman Governors and 
King Herod Agrippa.  
ANGLE ADJUSTS TO REVEAL - In the BG, Gizmo <DINGS>, then 
his meager ration of bread pops out of a toaster that is 
extended from his chest on the arm. It’s now toast.  
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   11
PAUL (CONT'D)
 Gizmo divides the toast into several pieces and 
distributes them to the others.
PAUL (CONT’D)
88
Finally, as a Roman Citizen, I had 
a right to be tried by Caesar 
himself. And so here I am, on my 
way to Rome.
MS - JOY looks down and considers his words.
WS - PROCIUS starts down the stairs to the hold.
PORCIUS
89
Alright, which of you prisoners 
wants a little fresh air! I need a 
crew to clean the decks!
JOY
90
Don’t pick me. Please, don’t pick 
me. This can’t get any worse.
PAUL
91
Joy.
Paul reminds her of when he said “I am strong” with a 
gesture.
PORCIUS
92
What about you, Christian?
He <CRACKS> his whip at Paul.
PAUL
(startled cry)
JOY
(fearful cry)
Centurion Porcius’ whip is unfurled toward Paul.
Paul falls to the ground.
CAPTAIN JULIUS (O.S.)
93
(sternly)
That’s enough!
He holds back PORCIUS with a hand, walks past him and 
helps PAUL to his feet.
PORCIUS
94
(Grunts)
PORCIUS is taken aback.
PAUL LOOKS IN THE CAPTAIN’S EYES FOR A QUICK BEAT - 
PAUL
95
Captain… would it be possible to 
loosen our shackles -- just while 
we are at sea?
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   12
 WIDER ANGLE - Porcius, outraged at this insolence, stops 
and whirls back to Julius.
CENTURION PORCIUS
96
Captain Julius, you cannot allow 
this filthy bunch of slave...!
Captain Julius, still looking at Paul - raises his hand 
as a way of cutting the Centurion off...
CAPTAIN JULIUS
97
Unshackle all of them. There is 
nowhere they can escape.
Julius turns and exits. Porcius glares daggers at Paul.  
As he crosses and bends to unlock Paul’s leg irons...
CENTURION PORCIUS
98
(close - nasty)
I’ll be keeping an eye on you -- 
Friend.
FADE OUT.

EXT. SEA - DAYS LATER
The ship sails. The sea is churning, the clouds are grey 
though light pours through them in spots.
EXT. DECK - CONTIINUOUS
CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO, LYSIUS, PORCIUS, and 4 PRISONERS are 
on deck. PAUL is heading for the prow.
PAUL moves to the edge side of the ship to look out.
PAUL’s POV - Prow pushing towards the cloudy sky.
There is a strong wind buffeting the ship.
EXT. SHIP’S FORECASTLE - CONTINUOUS
PAUL (NLT Acts 27:10)
99
Men, I believe there is trouble 
ahead if we go on -- shipwreck, 
loss of cargo, and danger to our 
lives as well.
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   13
 The sailors turn to listen.
SAILORS
100
(Laughter)
CAPTAIN LYSIAS
101
You don’t know what you’re talking 
about!  
(turning to Captain 
Julius while 
pointing off)
Captain, we must continue on. 
There are not suitable harbors 
here.  It is a poor place to spend 
the winter.  The crew knows these 
waters.  We should  continue 
further up the coast to Phoenix.  
SAILORS
102
(Laughter/”He doesn’t know what 
he’s talking about”/Mocking)
Julius glances at an impassioned Paul, then back at 
Porcius. Then he climbs the ladder to a higher level of 
the ship.
PAUL
103
I beg you to reconsider. 
CLOSE ON PAUL
PAUL (CONT’D)
104
I must get to Rome safely!
Paul attempts to approach Captain Julius, but Porcius 
blocks his way.

(Laughter)
Chris, Joy and Gizmo react with fearful gulps.
SAILOR 1/SAILOR 2
108
(Laughter, scoffing)
What does a prisoner from 
Jerusalem know about the open 
seas?
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   14
 Paul looks at them.
SAILOR 1/SAILOR 2 (CONT’D)
109
There isn’t a storm we can’t sail 
through.
Paul looks at the sailors, up at Julius, and hangs his 
head in defeat.
DISSOLVE TO:

CAPTAIN LYSIAS
114
Bind the hull! Use all available 
ropes!
ANGLE ON GIZMO Standing at the rail.  He gets a reading 
from a high-tech barometer extending from his chest.
GIZMO
115
According to the current 
barometric pressure, cumulonimbus 
formations, and wind velocity, 
there’s a 57% chance of...
<CRASH OF THUNDER> The deck is DRENCHED in a sudden wash 
of water.  Gizmo gets drenched.  Then does a deadpan...

The Ship’s Captain looks out at the sea.
EXT. SHIP’S DECK
Sailors 1 and 2 tug on ropes that are attached to the

SHIP’S CAPTAIN (O.S.)
117
Get the skiff on deck!
ANGLE ON THE SHIP’S LIFEBOAT NOW HOISTED UP ONTO THE DECK
SAILORS
118
(Fearful Walla)
The lifeboat hits the deck and goes into a roll across 
the ship.
CLOSE PAUL - he whirls and sees...
The lifeboat tumbles nearly crushing Captain Julius, 
who’s passing by. 
Paul leaps INTO FRAME and shoves Julius out of the way 
just in time. <CRASH> the boat careens past them and 
slams hard into the mast.
CAPTAIN JULIUS AND PAUL land next to each other. Chris, 
Joy, and the crew witness the close call. Gizmo is 
leaning over the side of the boat, sick.
CAPTAIN JULIUS/PAUL

Julius looks at the lifeboat, then at Paul.
CAPTAIN JULIUS
120
Thank you. (rising effort)

(Snoring/sleeping sounds)
The Crew and Kids are doing their best to sleep. 
CLOSE ON JOY, sleeping fitfully on a hard wooden shelf.  
Across the hold, full of uneasy prisoners, Paul is 
kneeling in the dark in silent prayer. He holds onto the 
staircase to steady himself. A shimmering white light 
begins to radiate from a point before him, then the hatch 
opens and light blazes down as an ANGEL appears.
ANGEL (NKJV Acts 27:24)
123
Do not be afraid, Paul, you must 
be brought before Cesar.  
(then NLT Acts 27:24)
What’s more, God in his goodness 
has granted safety to everyone 
sailing with you.
DISSOLVE TO:

Ship’s Captain shouts O.C. as Sailor 1 and Sailor 2 work 
behind him beside him, tossing cargo over the rail.

124
We must lighten our load, men!      
All excess cargo overboard!
CLOSE ON GIZMO - He reluctantly opens the door in his 
chest, takes out an ANVIL, and tosses it overboard.  <BIG 
SPLASH>

125
We need to dump cargo!!

GIZMO
127
Okay, but don’t blame me if we 
need it later. (efforts)
ANGLE ON - Paul, Chris, Joy, Gizmo, the Centurions and 
the crew have formed a bucket brigade-type line on deck, 
tossing cargo.
SB 207 "A Job to Do" Granat/Clark ANICON Script 9-5-12   17
 Chris tosses a bag, then a huge wave impacts the side of 
the ship, throwing him off balance. He grabs onto the 
railing.
PAUL - climbs atop the cabin roof and shouts down to the 
crew: 
PAUL (NLT ACTS 27:21)
128
Men, you should have listened to 
me in the first place and not left 
Crete! You would have avoided all 
this damage and loss!
CLOSER ON PAUL - with new heart.
PAUL (NLT Acts 27:22) (CONT’D)
129
“But take courage!  None of you 
will lose your lives, even though 
the ship will go down.”

Several fires are blazing in the dark. (Don’t need to see 
the crew members at the other fires a short distance off 
in the dark.  Gizmo sits next to a MALTESE MAN #1 cooking

escaped the sea, justice does not 
allow him to live.

into the fire. Paul rubs his hand and turns to the group.

Do not be afraid.  The snake is 
not harming me.
Chris, Joy and Gizmo stare in surprise.
The three Maltese Men are even more amazed and approach 
Paul carefully.
MALTESE MAN #1
176
It is impossible!  Truly, you must 
be a god!
PAUL
177
I’m merely a messenger of the One 
True God.  I’m on my way to Rome 
to preach His Word.
MALTESE MAN #1
178
Your God must be very powerful.
(he pauses, 
considering - the 
men glance at each

PAUL

I thank you for your kindness. 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo take Paul to one side, and speak to 
him confidentially.

Paul... I don’t get it.  Why go to 
Rome?  Why not stay here in Malta?  
These people love you.  But in 
Rome...
Paul smiles and cuts her off...
PAUL
189
Thank you for your concern, Joy.  
Jesus told me I must bear witness 
in Rome.  And that is what I will 
do. 
As Paul returns to ministering to the Publius’ father, 
Joy shakes her head in wonder, watching Paul.

her sleeves, and goes back to work, now with a big smile.
