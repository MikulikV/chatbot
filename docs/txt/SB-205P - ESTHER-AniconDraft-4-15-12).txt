CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: “Be (brave and) ready to do good things.  
Be the best/greatest for the benefit of others.”
SYNOPSIS:  Joy is challenged to stand up to a classmate who 
questions Joy's selection of a new girl at school to join a 
special club.  If Joy pushes for the new girl she could lose her 
own position in the club.  Superbook whisks the kids off to meet 
Queen Esther, who is facing a moral crisis of her own.   As Joy 
befriends the Queen, she learns that her own dilemma pales in 
comparison to the life and death choice Queen  Ester is grappling 
with.  At the moment of truth, Ether shows her true colors and 
stands up for what is right, even though it could mean death.  She 
is rewarded for her bravery, protects a nation, and with that Joy 
returns home full of the resilience and fortitude it will take to 
do the right thing in her situation at school.

                    Anicon Draft - 4-15-12
FADE IN:
EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATES OF KING XERXES' PALACE - DUSK 
In the shadows we see the backs of TWO MEN (friends of Haman) 
kneeling.  Towering over them is HAMAN, in princely raiment.  
The moonlight casts an eerie glow on Haman’s face.  
HAMAN 
1
Since the King’s friend, Mordecai, 
refuses to bow to me, let us cast 
lots and they will determine when 
his fate will be sealed. 
The men cast lots.  
CLOSER on Haman - he picks up the lot and nods ominously 
looking it in his hand.   
HAMAN (NKJV 3:6)(CONT’D)
2
So be it. On the twelfth month, 
Mordecai and all his people - all 
the Jews - throughout the kingdom 
of Xerxes – 
CLOSE on Haman’s face - an evil smile on his lips.
HAMAN (CONT’D)
3
- will be destroyed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE THRONE HALL OF KING XEREX - LATER THAT NIGHT 
KING XERXES sits on his throne. Mordecai approaches.  
KING XERXES
8
Ah!  Haman!  Good to see you, my 
friend! 
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       2.
 Haman approaches, bowing his head.  
HAMAN
9
If it please the king... I have 
disturbing news.
Haman eyes the Servant suspiciously - then leans in to speak 
confidentially to the King.  King's Servant #1 also leans in.    
HAMAN (3:8) (CONT’D) 
10
There is a certain people scattered 
amongst all the provinces of your 
kingdom; 
Haman shoots a warning look at the Servant and he pulls back.  
HAMAN  (NKJV 3:8) (CONT’D)
11
(Continues to the King)
Their laws are different from all 
other people's - and they do not 
keep the king's laws. 
CLOSER ON HAMAN AND KING Xerxes
HAMAN (NLT 3:8) (CONT’D)
13
So it is not in the king’s interest 
to let them live.
The servant reacts with a look.
KING XERXES
14
What would you have me do, Haman?
HAMAN (NKJV 3:9)
15
Let a decree be written that they 
be destroyed.
The Servant steps forward as though he’ll protest...
KING’S SERVANT
(A gasp)
CLOSER ON THE KING AND HAMAN 
KING XERXES
18
I... I trust you, Haman. If these 
people are a threat let the decree 
be written - and sealed.
The King removes his official ring to Haman.  (Esther 3:10) - 
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       3.
 PUSH IN ON HAMAN as he does a toady head bow but we see him 
smiling triumphantly looking at the ring out of the corner of 
his eye. 
FADE OUT.
ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. VALLEYVIEW SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY
INT. VALLEYVIEW SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MORNING 
FOLLOW WITH GIZMO as he whizzes around the gym in ROBO-ROLLER 
mode, shooting streamers and balloons from a "party cannon" 
attachments that is protruding on the arm from his chest. 
<WHOOSH-BOOM-POP-POW> He reaches the end of the room, does a 
fancy spin, and poses.
GIZMO
19
Who-hoo! Ta da!  
WIDE ON THE GYM - now festively decorated for a school dance.  
THREE GIRLS who have been watching cheer in delight!   
THREE GIRLS (FACES AWAY FROM CAMERA)
20
<Overlapping ad lib cheers!>
CAMERA PANS OVER to find JOY hanging balloons with JANICE, an 
“in crowd” girl and president of the Girls' Leadership Club.  
JANICE
21
As president of the Girls’ 
Leadership Club, I want to thank 
you for bringing Gizmo in to help 
us decorate for the dance, Joy.  
JOY
22
(big smile)
You’re welcome!  
CLOSER on Janice and Joy.  
JANICE
23
(with a giggle)
Too bad you can’t nominate him for 
club membership. 
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       4.
 JOY
24
What do you mean? 
JANICE
25
Well, you’ve been a member for 6 
months now, so you get to recommend 
another student for membership.   
The BELL RINGS.  Janice swoops up her schoolbooks to leave. 
JANICE (CONT’D)
26
You can make your recommendation at 
the meeting after school today.  
She hurries off.  Joy stands for a moment with a pleased 
smile on her face.  Then she sweeps up her own books and 
heads for the door as we... 
WIPE TO:
INT. A SCHOOL HALLWAY - SHORTLY 
Joy ENTERS FRAME and opens her locker.  A few kids pass as 
she collects her book.  She closes her locker door to reveal 
we now see - DOWN THE HALL ABOUT THIRTY FEET - BONNIE, a girl 
in an electric wheelchair, is  rolling towards her, checking 
her wheelchair gps. 
JOY
27
Need some help? 
Joy heads for her as BONNIE rolls to Joy.  The wheel chair 
has our “SB Future look.”  There is a small display screen 
touch pad on both armrests. She manipulates one pad as she 
jokes;   
BONNIE
28
Yeah. Unfortunately, I don’t have 
the school’s layout in my GPS yet.
       (smiling up at Joy) 
So I’m hopelessly lost!  
JOY/BONNIE
29
<Lightly laugh together> 
Bonnie looks down and taps the touch pad. 
BONNIE
30
I’m looking for room 12.
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       5.
 JOY
31
Oh. Just up the hall. I’ll show 
you!
JOY starts to walk and Bonnie rolls along beside her.  
BONNIE
32
I’m Bonnie Scott.  
JOY
33
Joy Pepper.  You’re new, huh? 
BONNIE
34
I’ve been here a week.  But you’re 
the first person who’s actually 
talked to me!  
They arrive at room 12 and Joy opens the door.  
JOY
35
Wow - algebra. I’m still struggling 
with Math! 
BONNIE
36
(Encouraging smile)
I’d be happy to help you with your 
homework - any time!  See you soon, 
Joy!   
Bonnie rolls in. As Joy turns to head back to her own class 
she sees Janice just a few feet away (she has been watching 
Joy.)  Joy hurries over.
JOY
37
(Excited)
Janice! I found the girl I’m going 
to submit for club membership 
today! 
JANICE
38
(With slight disdain)
You mean that girl in the 
wheelchair?
JOY
39
(Surprised by this)
Huh?  Well… yes.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       6.
 JANICE
40
She’s not right for our club, Joy.  
She can’t do service projects or 
cheer at the games... or anything. 
JOY
41
Sure she can.
JANICE
42
Hm... (then) - Well, I think 
submitting her name would be a bad 
idea for you, Joy.  
TRUCK IN ON JOY, looking troubled as she looks down... 
beat... then back up at Janice and we 
TIME DISSOLVE:
EXT. THE SCHOOL GYM - ESTABLISHING SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 
CHRIS (O.C.)
43
So what are you going to do, Joy?  
Your Club meeting’s about to start.
EXT. GYM DOOR - CONTINUOUS
Chris and Gizmo stand with Joy who paces, nervously, lost in 
thought.  
JOY
44
I don’t know.  Janice really 
doesn’t want me to submit Bonnie.  
And she is the president.  
CHRIS
45
That not right, Joy. You should 
tell her. 
Joy stops pacing and glares at them. 
JOY
46
No way!  Janice could have me 
kicked out of the club. I can’t 
stand up to her. I’m not that 
brave.   
SUPERBOOK (SFX) - Superbook rises from Chris' backpack.
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       7.
 JOY/CHRIS
47
SUPERBOOK! 
GIZMO
48
I think I’ll just head back into 
the gym and do some more 
decorating… 
But the Superbook EFFECT envelops the kids and Gizmo before 
he can leave and we  
JOY/CHRIS/GIZMO
49
Whoaaaa
CUT TO:
SUPERBOOK VORTEX - CONTINUOUS
The kids travel along.
SUPERBOOK (V.O.)
50
I am taking you to meet someone who 
found the courage to speak up for 
what was right no matter what the 
cost. 
CUT TO:
INT. KING XERXES' BANQUET HALL 
Gizmo, Joy, and Chris MATERIALIZE in the back of a group of 
newly arrived servants (slaves). A tall, muscular SERVANT 
OVERSEER stands in front of the group, looking grim.  
HATACH,(HAY’-TACK) the Queen’s favorite servant, is beside 
him.       
CLOSER ON KIDS & GIZMO - Gizmo checks his wrist chronometer 
and informs the kids; 
GIZMO
51
(whisper)
It appears we are now in ancient 
Persia - 5th century BC.  
SERVANT OVERSEER (O.C.)
52
Silence!  
Gizmo slaps his hand over his own mouth with a <CLANG.>
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       8.
 SERVANT OVERSEER (O.C.) (CONT’D)
53
You have been brought here to serve 
King Xerxes - ruler of 127 
provinces from India to Ethiopia 
(NKJV 1:1).  
Our heroes try to quietly tiptoe away from the group.  But 
the large SERVANT OVERSEER is suddenly right in front of 
them, glowering down at them in disapproval.  
SERVANT OVERSEER (CONT’D)
54
You!  You will follow my command 
and do as you are told.  
Chris and Joy share a worried look as the Servant Overseer 
looks to Hatach and instructs;
SERVANT OVERSEER (CONT’D)
55
Hatach - take the female to the 
Women's Quarters.  
Hatach bows and takes Joy by the arm. Joy shoots a concerned 
look at Chris as Hatach ushers her off.
JOY
NO!  CHRIS!!!!
Before Chris can say anything, the Servant Overseer grabs him 
by the arm and shoves Gizmo ahead of him.  
CHRIS
JOY!
GIZMO
Let me go!  Please!
SERVANT OVERSEER
56
And I will take these two to work 
with me at the Chariot House. 
WIDER - Chris and Joy look back at each other in concern as 
they are led off in opposite directions.  
WIPE TO:
EXT. THE CHARIOT HOUSE - DAY
(STAGING GEOGRAPHY NOTE - Though we won’t see this geography 
in this scene - it’s here for ref and later scenes.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       9.
 The stables are housed a building about two hundred yards 
from the palace.  There is a road that leads from the stables 
to the palace.  Half way to the palace the road splits and 
leads to a group of homes in the countryside below the palace  
One of the larger homes belongs to Haman and there are 
GALLOWS 70 ft high built in his courtyard. SEE SCRIPTURE REF 
found in ESTHER 7:9 NKJV - Gordon usually prefers the NKJV 
for scripture.  However, this visual has not been vetted, so 
please get historical reference approved whether it is 
standard “hanging gallows” that we might think of with the 
word “gallows” or is it the “sharpened pole 70 feet high” 
described in NLT and others.)
CLOSE ANGLE - A YOUNG SERVANT stands near TWO MUDDY CHARIOTS 
stage near a corner in the stables area. (Hidden around the 
corner are a line of chariots to be revealed later) (chariots 
- http://www.persianempire.info/Xerxes.htm. - Please double 
check with Erin for approval - not vetted) The Servant throws 
a pitcher of water on one and begins to scrub.  A moment 
later, Servant Overseer enters with Gizmo and Chris.  He 
shoves them roughly toward the chariots.   
SERVANT OVERSEER
57
You will scrub these chariots until 
they shine. 
He hands them both a very small brush.  Gizmo salutes.
GIZMO
58
Yes sir.  We shall do our best!
FAVOR CHRIS as he watches the Servant Overseer exit.  When 
Chris is absolutely sure he’s gone, he turns to Gizmo.
CHRIS
59
Come on, Gizmo!  Let’s go find Joy!
He tries to push Gizmo ahead, but the robot won’t budge.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
60
<Efforts>  Come on, Gizmo!  Go! 
GIZMO
61
I cannot just leave! I gave that 
man my word that I would scrub 
these chariots until they shine.   
Gizmo puts his hand over his “heart.”  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       10.
 GIZMO (CONT’D)
62
(Solemnly)
And a robot’s word is his bond.  
CHRIS
63
<Resigned sigh.>  Fine.  We’ll 
scrub first - then find Joy. 
Pleased, Gizmo pops a large buffer attachment from his chest 
and begins to polish a chariot.
GIZMO
64
(Whistling happily)
Next to him, anotherw orker looks at Gizmo’s speed - then 
eyes the brush in his own hand - waaay too small.  
Dispirited, he rolls his eyes, then turns and begins to scrub 
with the small brush. 
WIPE TO:
INT. THE WOMEN'S QUARTERS - MEANWHILE
Hatach stands with Joy in a lush room, draped with silks and 
strewn with pillows.  Joy is captivated by the sight.    
JOY
65
Wow!  Amazing!
A beautiful young woman (ESTHER) appears from behind her.  
She moves up next to Hatach. 
ESTHER
66
What is your name, young lady?
Joy is surprised and delighted to see the young woman. 
JOY
67
(Surprised and delighted)
Oh, hello!  I’m Joy…
HATACH
68
Bow when the queen addresses you.  
Joy reacts in great surprise - then embarrassment.  
JOY
69
The queen???  Oh, I… I didn't know… 
I...
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       11.
 Joy is so flustered that she bows deeply - then curtsies - 
then drops down to one knee.  Esther smiles warmly.   
ESTHER
70
<Warm laugh>  Of course you didn't.  
I'm not wearing my crown!  
Hatach hands Esther the ROYAL CROWN and she places it on her 
own head.  
ESTHER (CONT’D)
71
There.  Now do I look like a queen?  
JOY
72
Oh yes!  You look… beautiful!  
Esther, charmed by Joy’s ingenuous reactions, removes the 
crown and hands it to Joy so she can look at it more closely.
ESTHER
73
This crown first belonged to Queen 
Vashti, before she fell into 
disfavor with the king.
JOY
74
There was a queen before you? 
Esther looks over at Hatach in amused surprise.  
ESTHER
75
Hmm... She must come from a very 
far off land not to know this, 
Hatach.  
Hatach nods.
Joy grins.  
JOY
76
Oh yes.  Very very far off.  
Esther sits on a couch of pillows.    
ESTHER
77
When King Xerxes became unhappy 
with Queen Vashti, he began to look 
for someone to take her place.  
She pats the couch, indicating for Joy to sit next to her.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       12.
 ESTHER (CONT’D)
78
Many young women were brought to 
the palace.  The one who pleased 
him most would be his new queen.
Joy bounces down on the couch next to Esther.  
JOY
79
(With great excitement)
And the king liked you the very 
best of all, right?  
Esther laughs affectionately at her enthusiasm.  
ESTHER
80
(finds Joy endearing)
<Chuckles> 
Joy stares at the crown in her hand.
JOY
(light sigh)
Joy rises and places the crown she still holds onto her own 
head, swooning. Then, catching herself, Joy quickly removes 
the crown.
JOY (CONT’D)
81
(Shrug of embarrassment)
Oops.  Sorry.       
Ester reaches over and takes the crown - raises it - and 
places it back on Joy’s head. 
ESTHER
82
I think it looks beautiful.
JOY
83
(giggles)
WIPE TO:
EXT. ROYAL STABLES - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT as Chris, Gizmo, and Young Servant put the final 
polish on a chariot. Chris steps back and wipes his forehead.  
CHRIS
84
There.  Done.  Now can we go and 
find Joy?  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       13.
 Gizmo folds his buffer attachment away.  
GIZMO
85
It would seem the appropriate thing 
to do.  
Chris quickly turns to leave - 
CHRIS
All right!  Let’s go!
- only to <BUMP> right into the tall, muscular Servant 
Overseer’s chest.  
CHRIS (CONT’D)
86
Ooph! 
WIDE to include both chariots, gleaming.  Servant Overseer 
eyes the shiny chariots then nods his approval.  
SERVANT OVERSEER
87
Excellent work, slaves.  But you 
missed a few.
He turns and points around the corner.  Chris and Gizmo 
stretch the necks and peer around the corner.  
POV - REVEAL a LONG LINE of dirty chariots.
BACK ON Gizmo looks and smiles...
GIZMO
88
Well... a robot’s word is his... 
OH!
Chris yanks him O.C.  
CHRIS
89
Don’t say it.
He pushes him towards the line of chariots.
WIPE TO:
EXT. THE PALACE GATE AND SURROUNDING PALACE WALL - DAY
SHARP DOWN ANGLE (POV OUT ESTHER’S WINDOW) on MORDECAI, 
sitting outside the gates wearing sack cloth and ash.  A few 
CITIZENS pass by, on the street outside, obviously well-
dressed by comparison.       
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       14.
 HATACH
Your Majesty, I think I see your 
cousin down by the palace gate.
(animatic says “Cousin 
Merdecai” but we will 
change to simply “Cousin 
and pick it up before 
animation.)
CAMERA PULLS UP AND BACK INTO the women’s quarters.  Hatach 
has been looking out the window and turns to look into the 
room.
HATACH (CONT’D)
Come look.
NEW ANGLE
Joy and Esther cross from the lounge to the window.
JOY
You have a cousin?
ESTER
Yes, Mordecai. He raised me as a 
child.  In fact, he’s the one who 
brought me here to be made a queen.  
They reach the window, looking down at Mordecai at the palace 
gates.  
JOY 
91
That man raised you? He looks kind 
of… dirty.  
ESTHER 
92
(noticing)
Yes... He wears sackcloth and 
ashes…  that is the clothing of one 
who grieves.  
Esther turns to Hatach.  
ESTHER (CONT’D)
95
Hatach - you are my most trusted 
servant. Please go speak to 
Mordecai on my behalf.  Something 
is not right. 
Hatach bows and hurries off. 
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       15.
 Just then Esther and Joy hear the loud <CLATTER> of hoofbeats 
and shouts. 
FRIEND OF HAMAN #2 (O.C.)
97
... Bow to the most favored 
minister of the king!  BOW!
Esther and Joy rush to look out the window to look out again.
EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE PALACE GATES - P.O.V. LOOKING DOWN
Esther and Joy see HAMAN and his TWO FRIENDS (from the 
teaser) riding up the street toward the palace gates.  Along 
the street CITIZENS bow as Haman passes.      
Haman and his entourage reach the gates where Mordecai 
stands. They stop and wait for Mordecai to bow - he does not.  
CLOSE ON MORDECAI - He says nothing but continues to refuse.
CLOSE ON HAMAN - Haman rides his horse to within inches of 
Mordecai.  The horse’s hooves <CLATTER> on the street just 
inches from Mordecai’s feet - but still he does not bow.     
CLOSE ON JOY AND ESTER LOOKING DOWN - They are concerned.
JOY 
98
Why isn’t Mordecai bowing? 
CLOSE ON MORDECAI - Haman rears his horse up and the horse’s 
hooves paw the air, dangerously close to Mordecai’s head.  He 
stares up at Haman but refuses to bow.  
CLOSE ON JOY - She brings her hand to her mouth.
JOY (O.C.) (CONT’D)
99
<GASP!>  
BACK ON HAMAN AND MORDECAI
Unable to make Mordecai bow - or even flinch - he yanks the 
reins and turns his horse away and enters the gates.  
PUSH IN ON MORDECAI - He watches the O.C. Haman with a steady 
- steely stare of resolve.
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       16.
 INT. WOMEN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
Esther is very distressed as she walks away from the window.  
Joy stays at the window, still looking down.   
JOY
100
Why wouldn’t Mordecai bow??  He 
could have been hurt!   
ESTHER
101
One day I fear he will be hurt.  
Haman is a very powerful man.  
Joy brightens with an idea.  
JOY
102
But the king is more powerful, 
right?  
Esther looks at her and nods. 
JOY (CONT’D)
103
So talk to him!  Tell him you’d 
like him to keep Mordecai safe. 
Esther shakes her head, slightly amused by Joy’s naivete. 
ESTHER
104
I cannot tell King Xerxes what I 
would like him to do, Joy.  
JOY
105
Why not?  He’s your husband! 
ESTHER
106
He is also the king.  I cannot even 
go to visit him unless I am called.  
That is the law.    
CLOSER ON JOY as she ponders this.  
JOY
107
Oh.  
(pondering)
It can be really hard to speak up 
to the people who are in charge...
ESTHER
108
Yes.  It takes courage.  And I am 
not that brave.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       17.
 These words resonate with Joy as we… 
FADE OUT:
ACT TWO
FADE IN:
EXT. THE CHARIOT HOUSE - TIME LATER 
Haman and his two men ride up.  
ANGLE ON THE YOUNG SERVANT
He’s polishing chariots with Chris and Gizmo.  He drops his 
brush and runs to assist.  Chris and Gizmo look at one 
another and then follow suit.
ANGLE ON HAMAN AND HIS FRIENDS - They dismount.
FRIEND OF HAMAN #1
109
Still Mordecai will not bow to you, 
Haman!  The insolence!  
Haman waves his friend to be quiet as they toss their horses’ 
reins to Chris, Gizmo, and Young Servant.  
HAMAN
110
Do not worry about Mordecai.  Soon 
enough he will be dead.  Him and 
all those like him.
The kids pull their horses O.C. HOLD on Mordecai as he drops 
his voice and the kids don’t overhear this part. 
HAMAN (CONT’D)
111
I will construct gallows at my own 
home to enjoy the sight of his 
demise.
Haman and friends leave. 
Chris, Gizmo, and Young Servant begin to lead the horses to 
the stables.  Chris and Young Servant have cooperative horses 
who are easily led.  Gizmo’s horse refuses to budge.  
CHRIS
113
Who is “Mordecai”?

 We can see Gizmo in the background, humorously struggling to 
get his stubborn horse to move.  
YOUNG SERVANT
114
He’s a good man.  He saved the 
king's life once.
Gizmo struggles in the BG with a horse.
GIZMO
(effort sound)
CLOSER on Chris and Young Servant - Gizmo no longer in shot.
YOUNG SERVANT
115
Mordecai overheard two guards who 
were plotting to kill the king and 
he turned them in. 
Apparently Gizmo's stubborn horse has finally decided to move 
as we see it gallop past behind Chris and Young Servant with 
Gizmo hanging around the horse’s neck, holding on for dear 
life!  
GIZMO
116
Whoooaaaaa! 
Chris and Young Servant don’t seem to notice as they continue 
talking.  
CHRIS
117
So why does Haman think that 
Mordecai will be dead soon?  
Young Servant shrugs - this is just how it is.  
YOUNG SERVANT
118
(With a shrug)
Mordecai is a Jew.  Haman has 
written a decree that all the Jews 
in the kingdom are to be killed.  
Chris stops, surprised by this news.  
CHRIS
119
What?!?
Young Servant continues out of shot. 
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       19.

just heard.  
WIPE TO:
INT. WOMEN'S QUARTERS - SOON 
CLOSER on Esther’s troubled face as she stands holding 
Haman's decree, staring at it in disbelief. 
ESTHER
120
So, this decree is why my cousin 
grieves!  Haman must have lied to 
have it written!  
WIDER to show Hatach and Joy are with her.  Esther tosses the 
decree down angrily.  
ESTHER (CONT’D)
121
Someone must tell the king!  
Hatach boldly looks into Esther’s eyes and speaks.  
HATACH
122
Mordecai believes it is time for 
you to speak up for your people.  
Esther looks up at him in shocked surprise.  
Joy, confused by what she is hearing, moves up next to Esther 
to ask;  
JOY
123
(confused)
Your people? 
Esther gathers her courage and lifts her head proudly.  
ESTHER
124
Yes.  I am a Jew - just as my 
cousin is.  But King Xerxes does 
not know this.  
CLOSER ON ESTHER as she dictates her message to Mordecai.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       20.
 ESTHER (NKJV 4:11) (CONT’D)
127
(Speaking to Hatach)
Remind my cousin that anyone who 
goes into the inner court to the 
king who has not been called will 
be put to death…
Joy cannot help but gasp at this revelation. 
JOY

<Gasp!> 
ESTHER (NKJV 4:11)

holds out the golden scepter…   
X DISSOLVE 
EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE PALACE GATES - CONTINUOUS
Hatach speaks the last lines of Esther’s missive to Mordecai.  
HATACH (NKJV 4:11)
130
…Yet the queen herself has not been 
called to go into the king these 
past thirty days.  
Mordecai nods in understanding.  
MORDECAI (NKJV 4:13)
131
Tell the queen this: Do not think 
that you will escape in the king's 
palace any more than all the other 
Jews.  
X-DISSOLVE BACK
INT. WOMEN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS 
Hatach speaks the last lines of Mordecai’s response to 
Esther. 
HATACH (NKJV 4:14) 
132
And Mordecai said… “if you remain 
silent… deliverance will arise for 
the Jews from another place - but 
*
you and your father's house will 
perish.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       21.
 HATACH  (NLT 4:14) (CONT’D)
134
Mordecai also said, “Who knows if 
perhaps you were made queen for 
just such a time as this?”
Esther struggles and then makes a decision.
ESTHER
What Haman has done is wrong. I 
*
must talk to the king.  
Esther turns to Hatach.  
ESTHER  (NLT 4:15-16) (CONT’D)
137
Tell Mordecai to gather together 
all the Jews of Susa and fast for 
me. Do not eat or drink for three 
days, night or day. 
ANGLE on Hatach and Joy, listening intently as she continues;
ESTHER (CONT’D)
138
My maids and I will do the same. 
And then, though it is against the 
law, I will go in to see the king.
CLOSE on Esther - her face now reflecting her new strength 
and conviction.
ESTHER (CONT’D)
139
If the king holds out his golden 
scepter to me, I live.  If not, I 
die.  
WIDER - Hatach bows solemnly and respectfully and leaves.  
Joy turns anxiously to the queen, who suddenly appears very 
calm.  
ESTHER (CONT’D)
140
Either way, I have done what is 
right.  
CLOSER ON ESTHER’S FACE - now calm and fearless.  
ESTHER (CONT’D)
142
If I must die, I must die.

 EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PALACE - DAY
INT. THE THRONE HALL - DAY  
King Xerxes sits on his throne, reviewing a decree.
The king looks up to see
ESTHER, now in royal robes - looking extremely beautiful, 
stands just in arch of the throne hall door, looking strong 
and confident. She looks over to her left. 
POV - JOY is off to the side with a nervous expression - 
worried.
ON THE KING - his face shows no emotion as he beckons Esther 
to come closer.  
WIDER - No words are spoken as she moves regally to stand in 
front of him.  Leopard circles her legs.  
AT THE DOORWAY - Joy peeks around the door frame from just 
outside the door to watch. 
ON THE KING AND ESTHER - More silence as the king assesses 
Esther.  
ON JOY - fearful for the queen.  
ON KING AND ESTHER - At last the king holds out his golden 
scepter to Esther.  She reaches out to touch it.  When she 
does, the circling Leopard suddenly stands on his hind legs 
and playfully licks her cheek.      
ON JOY - she releases a sigh of relief.
JOY
144
(Loud whisper)
<Relieved sigh.> Yes!
FAVOR THE KING as he breaks into a big smile.  
KING XERXES
145
It pleases me greatly to see you, 
Queen Esther!  What do you wish? It 
shall be given to you - up to half 
the kingdom!  
Esther, now knowing that she is doing what’s right, speaks 
calmly.  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       23.
 ESTHER
146
Let you and your favored minister 
Haman come to a banquet I will 
prepare for you tonight.  
King Xerxes nods approvingly.  
KING XERXES
147
Wonderful idea!  It shall be done.    
WIPE TO:
INT. THE BANQUET HALL - LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSER on the heavy drapes covering the windows.  After a 
moment, Joy's head pokes out to look around to see  
POV - Two servants (one is King’s Servant #1) are setting 
dishes for a banquet on a low table.  Pillows and soft 
couches surround the table.  No one is seated yet.  
After a moment, King's Servant #1 looks over toward the 
drapes - as if he knows Joy is there.  
BEHIND THE DRAPES - Joy quickly pull her head back in and 
silently start backing up, hoping to avoid detection. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - shows that Chris and Gizmo are also behind 
the drape - and Chris is also backing up.  
Suddenly - BUMP - the two friends back right into each other!   
CHRIS/JOY
167
<Tiny little shrieks> 
CLOSER on their faces as they realize who they have bumped 
into! 
CHRIS
168
(Excited whisper)
Joy!  We found you!
GIZMO
169
Oh Joy!  It has been so many days!
Gizmo is so happy that he <CLAPS> his metal hands together in 
glee.  Chris and Joy turn to vigorously shush him! 
CHRIS/JOY
170
SSHHHHH!!!
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       24.
 JOY
Why do you smell like a horse?
CHRIS
(sarcastic)
Because a robot’s word is his bond.
The kids peer around the tapestry to watch the banquet being 
set by the two servants.  
CHRIS (CONT’D)
171
What’s going on? 
JOY
172
Last night Queen Esther held a 
banquet for the king and Haman, his 
favorite minister…
FAVOR Chris, listening.
JOY (CONT’D)
173
She’s holding a second banquet for 
them tonight so she can…  
Before she can answer, they hear a voice on the other side of 
the drape and freeze in place to listen; 
KING XERXES (O.C.)
174
Servants!  Some wine! 
Joy parts the drapes slightly and the three friends peek out.  
IN THE BANQUET HALL - King Xerxes, Esther, and Haman are now 
seated at the table.  The king sits in the center with Queen 
Esther on one side and Haman on the other.  The servants are 
filling their goblets with wine.  
King Xerxes speaks to Esther.  
KING XERXES (CONT’D)
175
We have joined you at this second 
banquet, my queen.  What else do 
you request from me? It shall be 
granted - up to half the kingdom! 
CLOSER on Esther

 ESTHER (CEV 7:3)
“Your Majesty, if you really care 
for me and are willing to help, you 
can save me and my people. 
FAVOR Haman, he stiffens, suddenly nervous about what she 
might say.  
ESTHER (CEV7:4) (CONT’D)
That’s what I really want. For we 
have been sold, my people and I. 
KING Xerxes reacts in surprise.  
KING XERXES
(Surprised by the news)
Your people have been sold?! 
QUEEN ESTHER nods solemnly.
HAMAN looks worried.  
BACK ON ESTHER
ESTHER
We have been sold, my people and I - 
to be destroyed, to be killed, and 
to be annihilated.  
The king looks surprised.
ESTHER (CONT’D)
Had we been sold as male and female 
slaves I would have held my tongue, 
although the enemy could never 
compensate for the king’s loss.
The king slams his fist down on the table.
KING XERXES (NKJV 7:5) 
Who is he, and where is he, who 
would dare presume in his heart to 
do such a thing?! 
FAVOR Esther as she looks Haman in the eyes and points.
ESTHER (NKJV 7:6)
That adversary and enemy is this 
wicked Haman!  
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       26.
 WIDE - The king rises and pounds the table in anger as he 
turns to Haman.  
KING XERXES
You!!  
Haman cringes - terrified.  
HAMAN
(grunt as he ducks)  But I but... 
your majesty...
Furious, the king throws down his wine goblet and storms out 
of the banquet hall.  
CLOSER ON HAMAN AND ESTHER - Haman rushes over and gets down 
on his knees in front of Esther to plead with her.  
HAMAN (CONT’D)
186
(pleading)
My queen - you must speak on my 
behalf!  If you do not, the king 
will surely kill me!    
Esther looks down at him stoically - unmoved. 
Haman throws himself at her, truly desperate! 
HAMAN (CONT’D)
187
(desperate)
I beg you!  Help me!  Do not let me 
die! 
We hear the king shout from O.C.
KING XERXES (O.C.)
188
WHAT IS THIS!?
Haman looks up, terror in his eyes.
IN THE DOORWAY OF THE BANQUET ROOM stands the king.  He has 
returned and, seeing Haman upon the queen, he is even more 
furious! 
KING XERXES (NKJV 7:8) (CONT’D)
189
Will he even assault the queen 
right here in the palace, before my 
very eyes? 
HAMAN
What... no... please....
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       27.
 FAVOR King's Servant #1, hurrying over to the king.  He 
points out the window toward Haman’s house.  There is a 
gallows in Haman’s courtyard.  
KING'S SERVANT #1 
190
Look. The gallows, fifty cubits 
high, which Haman made for Mordecai 
is standing at the house of Haman.
The King ponders the view for  along beat and then says...
KING XERXES
191
Hang him on it!  
CLOSE ON HAMAN cowering in absolute terror now. 
HAMAN
192
<Gasp!>  No!  
TWO GUARDS enter and lift Haman to his feet and take him 
away.  Haman hangs limply in their arms, head down, knowing 
he has been defeated.         
HAMAN (CONT’D)
(Protesting - No!  No!  Not me!  
Please!)
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE THRONE ROOM - SUNSET 
OVER THE SHOULDERS of Joy, Chris and Gizmo, standing at the 
back of the room, looking up at Mordecai and Esther, standing 
before King Xerxes.  
KING XERXES (NKJV 8:7)
193
I have given you the house of Haman 
and they have hanged Haman on the 
gallows because he tried to lay his 
hand on the Jews.  
FAVOR Esther as she kneels before the king.  
ESTHER (NLT 8:5) 
194
If it please the king, and if he 
thinks it is right, let there be a 
decree that reverses the orders of 
Haman…
CLOSE on Esther looking up at the king as she implores.
SB #205P - Queen Esther - Anicon Draft 4-15-12       28.

For how can I endure to see my 
people and my family slaughtered 
and destroyed?
FAVOR the king, looking down at her and nodding.  
KING XERXES (NLT 8:8) 
196
Send a message to the Jews in the 
king’s name, telling them whatever 
you want…
King Xerxes hand his signet ring to Mordecai. 
KING XERXES (CONT’D)
197
…and seal it with the king’s signet 
ring. 
TIGHTER on Esther and Mordecai sharing a triumphant moment 
together. 
MORDECAI (NLT 8:11)

We will write a decree giving the 
Jews in every city authority to

And Jews in every province and city 
will be filled with joy and 
gladness!

Esther had once her decision was made.  
JOY
202
I don’t need luck, Chris.  God is

Chris and Gizmo watch from the doorway as Joy marches inside.
INT. THE GYM - CONTINUOUS

corner of their eyes.  
IN THE DOORWAY, Chris and Gizmo stand observing and looking 
worried.
