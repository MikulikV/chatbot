 FADE IN:
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
The Three Wisemen travel on camels. They approach a bluff 
overlooking Jerusalem. The STAR shine high in the night sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. STONECYPHER HOUSE - NIGHT 
There are BLINKING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS strung everywhere and 
scores of Christmas character cut-outs on the lawn.   
We SLOWLY PULL BACK to REVEAL PROFESSOR QUANTUM peering 
through binoculars at the house across the street. During 
this shot we hear:
CHRIS (O.C.)
Hurry up, Giz! We gotta get down to 
the Mega Mall! It's almost time for 
the Annual Christmas Eve Scramble 
up Prize Peak!
INT. QUANTUM HOME - ENTRY - NIGHT
JOY is wearing a winter coat, hat, and scarf. CHRIS wears a 
ski jacket and scarf. The kids look O.C. down the hall, 
waiting for Gizmo. Professor Quantum turns and heads for a 
big box of Christmas decorations. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
My word! If that Stonecypher guy 
across the street puts one more 
cartoon cut-out on his lawn, I just 
may have to break out the 
inflatable "Mistletoe Reindeer!" 
He reaches into the box and an enormous PLASTIC reindeer 
begins to self-inflate - <WHOOSH>
FAVOR GIZMO - he enters the foyer on the run, holding a pair 
of Ice Piton Clamps for shoes.
GIZMO
Chris, I have your ice pitons to 
help you climb Prize Peak!
<KAPLOOOOWWWW> The sharp pitons run into the inflating 
reindeer and the decoration EXPLODES.
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY - they are scrunched back against the 
side wall, hands over ears, with their eye closed.  Gizmo 
zips in, looking O.C. rather guiltily.

 GIZMO (CONT’D)
(under)
Whoa...
Chris and Joy slowly open their eyes and look O.C.
JOY
That's one messed up reindeer.
WIDER ANGLE - The deflated-destroyed reindeer is draped over 
Professor Quantum who has been blown over by the closet door.  
His box is on the floor in front of him.  PHOEBE ENTERS from 
the other room carrying the manger scene.
PHOEBE
What in the world is going on, 
Crispin? 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo head past her towards the front door. 
CHRIS
Oh, Mom, we're headed off for the 
Christmas Eve Scramble up Prize 
Peak. 
Chris opens the door as Gizmo slightly raises his head and 
turns it backwards to face Phoebe.
GIZMO
That is correct, Mrs. Quantum.  
Chris could win...
(ala the commercials)
"...A jaw-dropping array of 
valuable toys and prizes that every 
child is dreaming about this 
Christmas."  
PHOEBE
Ah, Chris.  Before you go, can you 
set up the Nativity?
FAVOR CHRIS - He looks down at the nativity scene in Phoebe's 
hands.
HIS POV - it contains a Stable, complete with resin Nativity 
figurines: Joseph, Mary, Baby Jesus, Shepherds, Animals, etc.
CHRIS (O.S.)
But, I already put out the Santa 
and the elves and the snowmen...

 CHRIS (CONT’D)
... not to mention three hundred 
yards of Christmas lights...
She leans in and gives him a dig.
JOY
And a partridge in a pear tree? 
(giggle)
Chris shrugs, indicating around...
CHRIS
And, well, there isn't a lot of 
room left... anywhere. Uh, for 
that.  
Chris impatiently turns to the door. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Besides, it's no big deal.
He opens the door and zips out with Joy and Gizmo following 
as he calls back...
CHRIS (CONT’D)
The manger scene's just another 
decoration. See ya, Mom!
The door <SLAMS> SHUT FILLING FRAME.
CUT TO:
EXT. MALL WIDE SHOT - EVENING 
A light snow falls on a crowded parking lot.  There are 
shoveled snow banks along the walkways but the paths are 
clear for foot traffic.
TRACKING WITH CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They hurry towards the mall doors - about 20 feet away.  
Chris is in the lead and suddenly takes off ahead of the 
others EXITING FRAME as he shouts...
CHRIS
Last one into the mall’s a frozen 
blizzard-burp-with-slush-on-top! 
(laughing)
Gizmo throws a forefinger in the air - still on the move

 GIZMO
I, for one, certainly am NOT a 
blizzard-burp...
<SPLAT> a snowball has smacked into Gizmo’s faceplate.
CHRIS (O.S.)
(off camera laugh)
CLOSE ON GIZMO - Gizmo’s window washer pops out of his head 
and clears his faceplate. <SQUEEK-SQUEEK-SQUEEK>
GIZMO
Keep that up, Christopher Quantum, 
and you will be asking for a new 
robot for Christmas.
ANGLE ON CHRIS - as he side-slides (like a surf boarder pose) 
across the wet snow - right up to the mall doors. 
CHRIS
Who-hoo...
As he grabs the handle his attention is suddenly caught by a 
BOY and his MOM who stare in the store window that is just to 
the other side of the mall door.  CAMERA ANGLES OVER AND IN 
TO HIS POV - The window display shows a Christmas tree and 
presents piled up.   There is a table prominently displaying 
unwrapped items the stores are highlighting this Christmas.  
These are re-use designs only - A Holo-9 (existing model 
episode #102) - A Blender (existing model episode #101) - A 
Guitar (existing model episode #106) - A Stuffed Lion (reduce 
a real lion existing model episode #101) - A Skateboard, 
Helmet and Safety Pads (existing models episode #107) - A 
water rifle (Reuse existing model from episdoe #103) 
The little BOY is pressed to the glass, excitedly pointing 
from one item to the next.
BOY
Mom, look at all the cool stuff... 
I wanna get the guitar for Toby... 
and oh...oh... oh... and I wanna 
get the blender for Aunt Darcy, and 
that skateboard for ...
MOM
(cutting him off)
Jeffie!... Jeffie, I don’t know... 
CLOSE ON MOM - looking down at her son with soft eyes.

 MOM (CONT’D)
... it’s... I think it might just 
have to be a smaller Christmas this 
year. Those things are very 
expensive.
CLOSE ON THE BOY - The boy’s face visibly drops.  
MOM (CONT’D)
I'm sorry, honey.
He lets his mother’s hand go. (Body language needs to 
indicate his disappointment with showing disrespect.)
CLOSE ON CHRIS AT THE DOOR
He is watching the boy closely.  He furrows his brow - ever 
so slightly in thought --- suddenly <WHAP> a snowball 
explodes off the back of his head.
CHRIS
Heeeyyyy...
He wipes off the snow, hanging onto the door handle with his 
other hand.
FAVOR JOY AND GIZMO APPROACHING behind Chris
JOY
Who’s the blizzard burp now? 
(Giggle)
Chris starts to whip the doors open.
INT. MEGA MALL SHOPPING MALL - MAIN COURT - NIGHT
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - as they stare O.C. In awe.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Ohhh... amazing... incredible 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

CLOSE ON THE ANNOUNCER
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
.... you'll win every one of the 
fabulous Christmas gifts inside the 
Golden Christmas Cart. 
<COMICAL ANGEL CHORUS SINGS> - At the top is an oversized, 
gold-painted SHOPPING CART overflowing with GIFTWRAPPED 
PRESENTS.  Next to the cart are two ELVES waving down to the 
crowd below.
CHRIS JOY AND GIZMO - scurry closer.  They position 
themselves between two large fir trees with other Christmas 
decorations behind them. (NOTE: THE POSITION IS IMPORTANT SO 
THAT THEY ARE A BIT HIDDEN - SO WHEN SUPERBOOK APPEARS AND 
WHISKS THEM OFF, NO ONE ELSE AROUND THEM WILL SEE THIS ACTION 
OR REACT.)
BACK ON THE ANNOUNCER - He flips a switch on the see-through 
snowman.  A FAN at the bottom <WHIRS>.  The TICKETS SWIRL 
around inside.
CLOSER ON SNOWMAN - A TICKET feeds out of its mouth, like 
it's sticking out its tongue.  The Announcer plucks it and 
reads:
ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
And the winning ticket is -- two, 
three, four...
ON CHRIS - his eyes go wide as he hears:
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...Six, three!
Chris stares at the ticket he holds in his hand.
CHRIS
I won!  Joy!  Gizmo! All those 
gifts are mine! - Ha-haaa!  Ahh..  
this is what Christmas is all 
about! 
Just then, SUPERBOOK rises from the pocket of his jacket.

Chris looks at his winning ticket. It is suddenly whisked 
from his hand and send flying out behind a stand of Christmas 
trees.
CHRIS (O.C.)
My winning ticket!
The kids race behind the trees.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Superbook, I can't go now! I gotta 
climb Prize Peak!

INT. HEROD'S CASTLE - KITCHEN PANTRY AREA - CONTINUOUS
CHRIS and JOY APPEAR FALLING INTO a pantry area. There is an 
arch that looks out into the kitchen. (From time to time we 
should see SERVANTS passing with platters and pitchers, etc.

 Copyright (c) 2009 The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc.
 The kids land hard in a corner by some sacks of grain and 
shelves lined with folded linens, pitchers and serving bowls, 
etc.  
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Whoa... aghhh...(gasp in Ouch!)
Chris and Joy help Gizmo to his feet as their heads turn left 
and right, looking around, speaking in hushed tones.
CHRIS
Giz, where are we?
Gizmo rubs his backside.
GIZMO
(breathing) In the land of very 
hard floors.
Chris notes one of the servants pass the door, so he turns 
and grabs linens from the shelf.
CHRIS
Better try to blend in until we 
know what's what.
ON GIZMO - as Chris tosses a tablecloth over his head.
GIZMO
Blend in with what, the buffet 
table?
ANGLE ON THE DOOR OPENING - THE KING'S COOK passes and sees 
them in the panty. 
COOK
You! Servants! Bring the dinner 
platters into King Herod. Hurry!
BACK ON THE KIDS AND GIZMO - They hurry out of the pantry 
room with their table cloths draped around them as clothing-
cover.  The Cook follows.
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD'S GREAT HALL - DAY (MATTHEW 2:1-8)
KING HEROD sits at a table with TWO PRIESTS; a ROMAN GENERAL 
stands at rear.  On the other side of the table are the THREE 
WISE MEN. 
WISE MAN #1 
You honor us with your hospitality, 
King Herod.

 KING HEROD (O.S.)
And you honor me with your
presence.  
The kids ENTER FRAME and place the platters on the table 
as...
CLOSE ON HEROD
KING HEROD (CONT’D)
Three Kings traveling together over 
such a great distance... 
Remarkable.
(sipping his chalice - 
eyeing them a bit 
suspiciously)
What do you seek here in Jerusalem?
ON WISE MEN 
WISE MAN #1
Where is He who has been born King 
of the Jews?  
WISE MAN #2
For we have seen His star in the 
East.
WISE MAN #3
And have come to worship Him!
REVERSE - Herod turns and scowls at the Priests -- this is 
news to him.
KING HEROD
Perhaps my priests can assist you.
CLOSE ON PRIESTS
PRIEST #1
(fumbling)
Yes. ah... There is a prophesy. A 
ruler arising -- in Bethlehem.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO as they exit back through the 
draped kitchen entry.  They stop on the other side of the 
curtain to eavesdrop. 
Gizmo's video visor DISPLAYS a MAP of Ancient Israel; an 
ANIMATED LINE extends from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.
GIZMO
Bethlehem is a town approximately 
ten kilometers southwest of here.

 THE KIDS' POV - The Wise Men nod, pleased. 
KING HEROD
Bethlehem?  How... interesting.
(to Wise Men - rising)
My friends, you are certain to be 
weary from your journey. Ah-but 
once you have rested and have 
enjoyed a savory meal -- 
ADJUST TO UP ANGLE ON HEROD - as he leans forward hands on 
table.
KING HEROD (CONT'D)
-- go search for the young child.  
And when you've found Him, bring 
back word to me, that I may also 
come and worship him.
TRACKING SHOT - The Priests rise and exit with Herod, along 
with the General.  They speak low - on the move.
KING HEROD (CONT'D)
(under - on the move)
A 'King of the Jews?' Never!  
TRACKING SHOT SLOWS - Herod and his men stop in proximity to 
where the kids are hiding behind the kitchen curtain - but 
Herod's eyes avert to check that they are far enough from the 
guests back at the dining table, in order to speak candidly. 
KING HEROD (CONT’D)
(sotto to General)
If they don't find this infant, 
I'll have my men search for him. 
Even if it means... 
ZOOM INTO A CLOSE-UP OF HEROD
KING HEROD (CONT’D)
-- rounding up every boy child born 
within the last two years. No 
infant born in my realm shall grow 
up to challenge my reign!
ANGLE IN THE KITCHEN - The kids are leaning, listening at the 
drape.  They can hear Herod and his men move off. <FOOTSTEPS 
RECEDE)  Chris, Joy and Gizmo gasp at what they've overheard.
JOY
What are we going to do? 
CHRIS
What can we do, Joy?

 Suddenly, the SUPERBOOK EFFECT SHIMMERS.
GIZMO
It looks like Superbook has an idea 
of his own. Whoaaa....
They DISAPPEAR into the shimmering light.
SUPERBOOK WIPE 
TO:
EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM - DAY
CHRIS AND JOY LAND DOWN WITHIN SUPERBOOK'S SIGNATURE GLOW.  
They arrive in a ditch with their backs to a road.  
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Whoaaa...
They sit up and look around.
JOY
Where are we now, Giz?
Gizmo flips open his chronometer and eyes it. Suddenly 
<CRASH>  THUNDER AND LIGHTNING EXPLODE - They all look 
upwards and rain begins to fall.  They suddenly hear busy 
crowd wallah...
CROWD (O.S.)
(General walla) Find some cover. 
Over this way.... Over by those 
trees, etc...)  
They whirl and see a group of people running off the road - 
straight towards them.  These are ISRAELITE TRAVELERS. Some 
carry belongings.  Some walk with staffs.  
The crowd passes O.C. and then a bearded man (JOSEPH) leads a 
DONKEY carrying his very pregnant young wife (MARY).  
(STORYBOARD NOTE: Please try to follow the upcoming shot cuts 
in order to eliminate a lot of unnecessary animation with the 
donkey. Keep the Donkey's head in frame as you shoot Joseph 
but try to do individual "tracking single shots" on the 
others until they all reach the cave.)
JOSEPH
(urgent)
Excuse me, could you please assist 
us? My wife is with child.
<CRASH> THUNDER and LIGHTNING - CLOSER ON MARY - very 
pregnant on the donkey.

 JOSEPH (CONT’D) (O.S.)
We must find shelter from this 
storm.
BACK ON GROUP - FAVORING GIZMO - His back is to Mary and 
Joseph so they can't see his faceplate scanning with an RED 
LINE RUNNING BACK AND FORTH.
GIZMO
My geo-sensors indicate there is a 
small cave just beyond that rock 
formation. I shall lead the way.
He starts off.  The others follow.  Joseph leads the Donkey 
with its rope.  
JOY
I'm Joy. This is Chris.
CHRIS
And our fearless leader up ahead is 
Gizmo.
CLOSE ON GIZMO - he suddenly freaks looking down
GIZMO
SNAAAAAAAAKE! 
(then looks closer)
No. Stick. Just a stick. False 
alarm. Press on.
TRACKING BACK CHRIS, JOY, MARY JOSEPH - Joseph chuckles
JOSEPH
(chuckling) Gizmo is a curious one. 
TRACKING CLOSE ON MARY - looking down at the kids walking 
beside her.
CHRIS
Where are all these people 
traveling?
FAVOR JOSEPH
JOSEPH
Did you not hear? All have been 
called to return to the places of 
their birth.
FAVOR MARY
SB #108 "Christmas" REV Sync Script 8-17-11  13.

 MARY
Caesar Augustus, the leader of 
Rome, has decreed that all the 
world should be registered.
CLOSE ON JOY
JOY
What do you mean, 'registered?'
JOSEPH
He has called for a "census" -- so 
that they know who everyone is and 
where their families come from.
CLOSE ON MARY
MARY
(small pain)
Oh...
Joseph tugs the donkey's rope and moves ahead, towards Gizmo, 
as Chris and Joy slow down to speak privately.  
CHRIS
Do you think.. I don't know... that 
they could be the ones who are 
having the baby King Herod was 
talking about?! 
MUSIC KEYS THE POINT as they share a surprised look and then 
turn to - 
CAMERA ANGLES to show Gizmo has found them shelter in a low 
"cave."  Mary is now off the donkey.  Joseph is putting a 
shawl over her shoulders.  
JOY (O.S.)
(slow - with meaning)
Mary... Joseph... and the baby, 
Jesus.
BACK ON CHRIS AND JOY
CHRIS
(quick - putting it 
together)
Oh... The real ones... the ones, 
you know, from the nativity scene 
my mom wanted me to set up back 
home.

 BACK TO THEIR POV - THE CAVE - CLOSE ON MARY AND JOSEPH - 
Mary sits and Joseph kneels beside her holding her hand - all 
will be okay.
CHRIS (CONT’D) (O.S.)
I can't believe it's them.
JOY (O.S.)
Chris, do you think they have any 
idea people remember them more than 
2000 years from now?
PUSH IN SLOWLY on Mary with Joseph standing, tending her.
SLOW DISSOLVE 
TO:
EXT. THE CAVE - CAMPFIRE - THAT NIGHT
CLOSE ON A <CRACKLING> FIRE. PULL OUT TO REVEAL our travelers 
seated beside the parents-to-be. Joseph breaks off a PIECE OF 
BREAD for Mary and then hands some to Chris.
JOSEPH
We should reach Bethlehem tomorrow.
GIZMO - seated on the far side of Joy, holds up a thumb.  It 
rotates and makes a Medical Tricorder sound <WEEWHEEWEEWHEE> 
with a glowing LIGHT.  His VISOR DISPLAYS Mary's BIOMETRIC 
DATA.
GIZMO
That would be most advisable. My 
medi-scan indicates Mary is almost 
ready to have her baby.
Chris puts her hand over Gizmo's to hide the thumb. His 
faceplate stops registering.
CHRIS
(weak chuckle - like a dad 
to a kid)
Eee...Put away your toy, Gizmo.
(quickly, to Mary)
So, Mary, you must have been pretty 
excited when you found out you 
were... well... you know... gonna 
be a mom?
TWO SHOT - Joseph and Mary share a smile.

told to me by an angel.
BACK ON OUR THREE
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
An ANGEL?

MARY
I was at my parents' home. And 
there came a light, brighter than 
any I had ever seen.  Brighter than 
the sun...
The scene blasts with a BRILLIANT LIGHT
DISSOLVE TO:

Mary recoils as an ANGEL appears.
ANGEL
Do not be afraid, Mary, for you 
have found favor with God.  
CLOSE ON MARY
ANGEL (CONT’D)
And behold, you will conceive in 
your womb and bring forth a Son, 
and shall call His name Jesus.

ANGEL (CONT’D)
He will be great, and will be 
called the Son of the Highest; and 
the Lord God will give Him the 
throne of His father David.
DOWN ANGLE ON MARY - rising to her knees, gazes upward, awed.
ANGEL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
And He will reign over the house of 
Jacob forever, and of His kingdom 
there will be no end.

ANGEL
The Holy Spirit will come upon you, 
and the power of the Highest will 
overshadow you; 
DOWN ANGLE ON MARY - as she smiles beatifically in the GLOW.
ANGEL (CONT’D)
Therefore, also, that Holy One who 
is to be born will be called the 
Son of God.
DISSOLVE BACK 
TO:
EXT. CAMPFIRE - RESUME ACTION - NIGHT
Chris, Joy and Gizmo listen, slack-jawed. Gizmo asides:
GIZMO
That's something you don't hear 
every day.
Chris pokes Gizmo in the side <THUD> -- then rubs his elbow.
JOSEPH
At first, I was... upset to learn 
Mary was pregnant, because we were 
not yet married. But an Angel came 
to me in a dream and reassured me.  
(taking Mary's hand and 
holding it to his chest)
I knew then, for certain, that God 
wanted us to be husband and wife!
ON KIDS AND GIZMO - Chris, however, suddenly becomes 
concerned.  He stands.
CHRIS
Um... Would you excuse us for a 
minute?
Chris pulls Joy and Gizmo into a huddle in F.G.  The 
campfire, Joseph and Mary are in B.G.  All whisper:

 CHRIS (CONT’D)
Joy, it's definitely them! And 
they're gonna be toast if Herod's 
men find us!
JOY
How is King Herod going to track 
down one little baby in a country 
this big?
CHRIS
What, do I have to do all the 
thinking around here, Joy?  It's 
the census!  His soldiers will know 
who everyone is... who's having 
babies... or had a baby in the last 
two years!  
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Mary and Joseph will be on that 
list... along with the baby!
Chris looks off, startles, and points.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Oh no!  They already know we're 
here!
Joy and Gizmo whirl to look at:
POV - A NEARBY HILLSIDE - several SILHOUETTED FIGURES stand 
along the top of a hill.
RESUME KIDS AND GIZMO - all tense.  Chris whispers to Gizmo:
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Gizmo! Initiate a trans-structural 
thermal scan and find out how many 
more are behind that hill!
Gizmo's VISOR GOES RED as he follows Chris's command.
GIZMO
Data indicates there are 
hundreds... 
CHRIS (INTERRUPTING)
HUNDREDS!!! See, Joy?! HUNDREDS!
GIZMO'S POV - An INFRARED SCAN of the SILHOUETTED FIGURES 
RESOLVES into... SHEPHERDS standing beside several SHEEP.  
The shortest Shepherd is a BOY, about Chris's age.

Yes, Chris. HUNDREDS!... of sheep

shepherds up top as well.

JOY
Shepherds. (giggle) Most dangerous 
men alive. (giggling) - Now will 
you give it a rest, Chris
CHRIS
Hey, they could've been soldiers!  
We gotta be ready.

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Superbook said we were going to 
witness the greatest gift the world 
has ever received... and he was 
talking about her baby.

AHEAD - A ROMAN SOLDIER #1 stands at a CROSSROADS, 
*
questioning the MAN at the head of the line.  
SOLDIER #1
*
If you do not have family in 
Bethlehem, move along. There's no 
place to stay here.
IN THE LINE - Joy stands beside Mary on the Donkey, looking 
up at her, concerned.  Mary holds her stomach, wincing, then 
looks down at Joy and smiles.

 CROWD
(disgruntled walla)
PAN AHEAD TO Gizmo, Chris and Joseph, who holds the Donkey's 
reins.
Joy looks up at Mary.
MARY
(grunt of discomfort)
She holds her belly in slight pain. Then looks down at Joy 
with a smile.
ANGLE ON JOSEPH AND CHRIS
CHRIS
Joseph, aren't you worried -- you 
know, about Mary and the baby, with 
all that's going on?
Joseph ruffles Chris' hair as if to say, "Don't worry."
JOSEPH
God has a plan, Chris.  
Chris leans out of the line and eyes the Guard who's checking 
everyone at the front of the line.
SOLDIER #1 (O.C.)
*
Move along. I told you there's no 
place to stay.
CHRIS
(sotto)
Maybe so.  
SOLDIER #1 (O.C.)
*
Move along.
CHRIS
But it's Herod's plan that still 
worries me.
JOSEPH
I beg your pardon?
CHRIS
Uh... Sorry, nothing.
(beat, frustrated - 
looking around, then 
sotto to Joseph)
Joseph? What if you're wrong?

 I mean, what if God doesn't come 
through?  
Joseph kneels and puts a fatherly hand on Chris' shoulder and 
smiles at the boy.
JOSEPH
Chris, you heard, He told Mary His 
son would reign over the house of 
Jacob forever. And of His kingdom 
there will be no end. 
Joseph moves forward with Mary and the donkey.  Gizmo steps 
up beside Chris.
CHRIS
If they're not going to listen to 
us, what's the point of even 
trying?
JOY
Chris?!  Would you stop being so 
paranoid and just think for a 
minute?
CHRIS
Think?? About what?
JOY
About how incredible this is! You 
want to talk about a gift? Look at 
us! Superbook is giving us front 
row seats for the very First 
Christmas ever! This is what 
started the whole celebration.
Chris throws up his arms, indicating around.
CHRIS
Please! You call this a Christmas?  
GIZMO
Yes! Where are the parties?  
CHRIS
Where's the Christmas tree and all 
the decorations?
GIZMO
Yes. And where is Santa Claus?

CHRIS (CONT'D)
 CHRIS
Old Stonecypher across the street, 
he has more Christmas spirit with 
all those decorations on his front 
lawn then anything I'm feeling 
around here.
CLOSE ON JOY - she throws her arms up in the air in 
frustration and walks off.
JOY
Guys, I think you're missing the 
point. 
PUSH IN ON Gizmo and Chris as they react - a couple of guys.
GIZMO
But... I love Santa.
CHRIS
Yeah... And Rudolph.
GIZMO
Yes.  What has put her Christmas 
all in a crunch?
CHRIS
Exactly.
WIPE TO:
EXT. STREET - TOWN OF BETHLEHEM - NEAR A WELL - DUSK
Chris, Joy, Gizmo, Mary, Joseph and the donkey walk along 
with a few other travels from the "road' 
ANGLE - WELL - Chris passes in the F.G. And looks off to one 
side, where SOLDIER #2 and Soldier #3 stand by the well, 
*
watching the crowd go by. One of them meets Chris' gaze -- 
and starts toward them!
BACK ON OUR GROUP - Chris looks around for an escape route.
CHRIS
Uh-oh -- here comes trouble!
ON MARY, THE DONKEY AND JOSEPH - as the Soldier steps over, 
eyeing Joseph and Mary.
SOLDIER #2
*
Is this your wife?
Chris squeezes between Mary and Soldier #2, trying to block 
*
his view of her bulging belly.

 CHRIS
Ah, no problem here.  We're fine. 
*
All fine.  
*
THE SOLDIER - scowls at Chris, then turns to Joseph.
SOLDIER
When is she due to have the child?
REVERSE - Joseph replies calmly.  At rear, Chris winces.
JOSEPH
Soon.
THE SOLDIER - points O.S.
SOLDIER #2
*
Try the last tent down the road. I 
hear they have room. Perhaps you 
can stay the night. 
JOSEPH
Thank you.
He exits. Joseph leads the Donkey carrying Mary O.S. HOLD ON 
Chris as he turns and whispers to Joy, despairing:
CHRIS
See! Now the Romans know where she 
is!
JOY
Chris, for the last time. God is 
not going to let anything bad 
happen at the birth of His son.
Shaking her head, Joy moves off.

CUT TO:
EXT. MAIN TENT - NIGHT
MAN #1 is an unkempt, heavy-set fellow. He stands in the door 
140
of his large tent and shakes his head at Joseph, Chris and 
Joy.  Gizmo stands several yards away holding the donkey's 
rope.  Mary still sits atop the donkey.  
MAN #1
How many times do I have to say it?
(impatient)
My room is taken. 
Joseph looks dismayed. He SIGHS to the kids...

 JOSEPH
I shall inform Mary.
...and moves O.S. Joy stands up to the Man.
JOY
Oh, you! How can you send them 
away?  They're going to have a 
baby! TONIGHT!
CLOSE ON Man #1 - he may be surly, but he's not cruel.
MAN #1
Please... I do not mean to be 
harsh. But, with all the travelers 
there's nowhere left to stay. - All 
I have is a stable out back for 
oxen.  
JOY
A STABLE???
He points off behind the tent city.
MAN #1
By that cliff. You and your family 
can stay there.  
JOY
You want the savior of the world to 
be born in a STABLE?  
CHRIS
History's in the making, mister.  
You got a chance to really step up 
here but instead, you....
INNKEEPER
It has walls and a roof. Do you 
want it or not?
Joy points in the direction of Joseph and Mary.
JOY
Do you know who Mary and Joseph 
are?  
CHRIS
That baby they're going to have is -
MAN #1

WHAT, AM I SPEAKING A FOREIGN 
LANGUAGE?

 Chris and Joy straighten up in fear and blurt out...
JOY/CHRIS
We'll take it!
Joy grabs Chris by the arm and yanks him O.S. 
CUT TO:
INT. STABLES - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT (LUKE 2:6-7)
Chris, Joy and Gizmo step inside the cave-like stable about 
six feet deep. They look crestfallen.
THEIR POV - WATER DRIPS from above; the floor is muddy with 
wet straw.  A MANGER sits at rear.  A SHEEP eating some hay 
there looks up from, chewing and offers a plaintive <BLEATING 
SFX>
CLOSE ON CHRIS - recognizing the scene.  Now it hits home.
CHRIS
This is where the Son of God is 
going to be born? 
JOSEPH (O.C.)
Joy! Chris!
The kids whirl.
Joseph approaches, helping Mary inside as she catches her 
breath...
MARY
(pained)
Oh! The baby -- He's coming! Oh...
ANGLE ON KIDS AND GIZMO - as they trade anxious looks...
JOSEPH
There are blankets on the back of 
the donkey. We'll need some clean 
water.
PUSH IN ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO...

 FADE IN:
EXT. BETHLEHEM OUTSKIRTS - CONTINUOUS (LUKE 2:8-14)
Chris stumbles up a HILL behind the town, carrying a bucket 
and looking about in desperation.  Joy, carrying the lamp, 
and Gizmo follow him.
CHRIS
(climbing effort)
JOY
(calling)
Chris, where are you going?
CLOSER ON CHRIS - as he turns to face the others and throws 
down his bucket in frustration.
CHRIS
I don't know! I'm looking for a 
stream, a lake, anything. I just 
don't want to go back to town near 
that well with the soldiers!
He finally throws the bucket down and sits - exhausted.
GIZMO
What is the matter, Chris?
CHRIS
Isn't this bothering anyone else 
but me?
JOY
What?  Trying to find water for 
Mary and Joseph?
CHRIS
No! I mean all of this! I want to 
help, I want to believe, but, if 
Mary's really giving birth to the 
Son of God, why isn't God helping 
us even a little bit, Joy?  
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON NIGHT SKY

Do not be afraid, for behold, I

manger.
WIDE ON HILLSIDE - with a <THUNDERCLAP>, the Angel's BLINDING-
BRIGHT BRETHREN appear beside him.  - "And suddenly there was 
with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host."

Just as suddenly, the ANGELIC HERALDS arc skyward, <WHOOSH!>

Hi, we're back -- and, um, we have

 Chris, Joy and Gizmo watch as the ANGELS DESCEND through the 
ceiling and hover above baby Jesus and his parents.
CAMERA PANS from Gizmo, to Joy, and finally settles on Chris.  
He asides to Joy:
CHRIS
Joseph was right. God's plan did 
come to be -- not in the way anyone 
expected -- 
JOY
But just the way God meant for it 
to happen!
WIDER ON SCENE - with Joseph and Mary admiring their newborn, 
Chris, joy and Gizmo disappear in a SUPERBOOK SHIMMER.  
The Shepherds tentatively enter, providing a final TABLEAU 
with Joseph, Mary, Jesus, the Angels, the Shepherds, the 
Sheep, the Donkey and the Cow.
SUPERBOOK - (JOHN 4:10)

God, but that he loved us and sent 
his Son for all people.

JOY
Well, are you going to try to climb 
prize peak?
CLOSE ON CHRIS - he smiles and shakes his head.
CHRIS
You know what? -- every Christmas 
since I can remember, I wanted to 
win a chance to do this. To me this 
was the ultimate - what Christmas 
was all about...But it's not.

the mall window at the beginning. Chris crosses to him and 
taps his shoulder then hands him the winning ticket.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Merry Christmas.
The Child watches our trio walk away.  He then looks down at 
the ticket.  His eyes slowly go wide as he hears:
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
One more time, that's two, three, 
four, six, three.  Anybody?
The boy jumps up and down and waves his arms...
BOY
Me! Me! I have it! I'm climbing 
Prize Peak! Who-hooo!

Oh, honey, that's wonderful! What a 
Christmas miracle!

When Stonecypher's house is visible with all its lights and 
decor - the LIGHTS SUDDENLY FRITZ OUT.
STONECYPHER (O.C.)
Oh no! Not my lights again!
...and rising up into the sky high over the neighborhood, 
where a STAR, like the one we saw above Bethlehem so many 
years ago, 
GLISTENS like a beacon of hope for all who believe.  As its 
LIGHT FILLS FRAME:
FADE OUT.
