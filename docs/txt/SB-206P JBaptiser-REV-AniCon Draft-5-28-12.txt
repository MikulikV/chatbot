SUPERBOOK 
"Nothing But the Truth"
(John the Baptist)
Episode 206P
CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY - “Live truthfully and point others to 
Jesus”
LOG LINE:  When Chris is faced with a challenge between choosing 
to act truthfully or to take the easy (and more “fun”) pathway, 
Superbook whisks the kids back to meet John The Baptizer.  During 
an exciting journey that takes the kids from witnessing John 
preach and baptize on the Jordan River, all the way through to his 
incarceration and ultimate death at the hands of Herodias and King 
Herod, Chris comes to understand what it means to live truthfully 
and point others toward in the direction of being more like Jesus.  
When Chris returns home, he applies what he's learned.  Although 
it doesn't change the boy he is trying to help, Chris himself is 
that much stronger for the effort he's putting in and for the 
experience of meeting John the Baptizer firsthand!

 TEASER
FADE IN:
EXT. RIVER JORDAN - DAY 
A CROWD OF PEOPLE (Including a few Pharisees) stands at 
the river’s edge. PAN PAST TWO DISCIPLES who line up 
members of the CROWD waiting to enter the water.  
SETTLE on hirsute JOHN THE BAPTISER waist deep in the 
JOHN
Repent of your sins and turn to 
God for the Kingdom of Heaven is 
near.
<SPLASH> - Soaked, Man #1 rises and grins gratefully.  
Disciple #2 ENTERS FRAME and ushers Man #1 from the 
river. 
ANGLE ON THE CROWD - it slowly parts a someone comes 
through - a beat as they move - and then we REVEAL JESUS.  
He stops at the river’s edge.  PUSH IN - as a slight 
smile comes to him.  
JESUS
John.
ANGLE ON JOHN - He looks at Jesus.  His eyes drops 
slightly for brief second - and then they return to 
Jesus. John trudges through the water to the shore.  He 
stops before Jesus.  They exchange looks.
CLOSE ON JESUS
CLOSE ON JOHN
JOHN [MATTHEW 3:14 CEV]
I ought to be baptized by you.  
Why have you come to me?
CLOSE ON JESUS
JESUS [MATTHEW 3:15 CEV]
For now, this is how it should be, 
because we must do all that God 
wants us to do.
CLOSE ON JOHN - He hesitates -- how can John absolve He 
Who is Without Sin -- of sin?  
CLOSE ON JESUS - Jesus nods, urging him to continue.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   2.
 ANGLE ON THE WATER - Jesus and John ENTER FRAME - waist 
deep - (PRODUCTION NOTE: Please verify with researchers 
if Jesus should now be stripped or still wearing robes.)
IN SLOW MOTION - Jesus is submerged in the Jordan [ART 
NOTE: see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mglIAIdU3ik from 
the Jesus film for reference - Please double check this 
action/video with CBN RESEARCH for accuracy; the water 
swells and settles.  Then, after what seems like forever, 
John raises up Jesus.  Suddenly --
WIDE - <THUNDERCLAP SFX>, a BLINDING ANGLED SHAFT OF 
LIGHT parts the clouds.  The Spirit of God descends in 
the FORM OF A LIGHT SHAFT AND IN THE LIGHT - FORMED BY 
BRIGHTER LIGHT - IS THE SHAPE OF A DOVE - A DOVE MADE 
COMPLETELY OF LIGHT.  (NOTE: No other effects should 
appear in this scene - no swirling clouds, winds or water 
movement.  Just pure light and THUNDER)
The CROWD look sup in wonder.
JOHN looks up.
CLOSER ON JESUS- as the LIGHT-DOVE alights just above Him 
for a brief beat... and then it descends INTO Jesus while 
Jesus calmly gazes upward and we hear... 
GOD (V.O.)
This is My beloved Son, in whom I 
am well pleased.
WIDEN OUT ON TIGHT TWO SHOT INCLUDING JOHN Standing 
beside and slightly behind Jesus:
FADE OUT.

GIZMO and JOY sit at the table and look up as CHRIS 
enters with his HOLO 9 Helmet.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   3.
 CHRIS
Ah, het Giz, can you run a test on 
my Holo 9 Game Helmet?  It’s been 
real slow since I got it back.
Gizmo takes the helmet and cocks his wrist.  A PROBE pops 
out.  He inserts it into the back of the helmet as... 
JOY
Got it back?  Did you lose it?
CHRIS
Naw.  I let Sam borrow it.
ANGLE FAVORING GIZMO - who withdraws the probe from the 
helmet; <ZIP-CLICK>, it reels back into his wrist.
GIZMO
I see what is wrong, Chris.  There 
are several new games stored in 
your helmet’s memory.
(beat, disapproving)
The odd thing is, none of these 
titles are available for sale.
JOY
Sam put stolen games on your 
player?
CHRIS
No!  I’m sure there’s a simple 
explanation.  
<BEEPING SFX>  Chris pulls out a HANDHELD VIDEOPHONE and 
taps a button. 
CLOSER ON VIDEOPHONE - SAM appears on the screen.  A big 
round-faced kid with a perpetual know-it-all smirk.
SAM (FILTERED)
Hey, Chris.  You find the games?
REVERSE - Joy gives Chris a look. 
CHRIS
Uh, yeah.
SAM(FILTERED)
Rad, huh?
CLOSE ON VIDEOPHONE SCREEN - Sam boasts:
SAM (FILTERED)
I just downloaded them from a new 
bootleg site I found.
WIDEN AS Joy turns Chris’s hand so the phone faces her.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   4.
 JOY
Bootleg, huh?  As in stolen?
CLOSE ON PHONE
SAM (FILTERED)
Relax, Kill Joy.  It's no big 
deal.
BACK ON TWO SHOT Chris and Joy
Joy glares at Chris.  Embarrassed, Chris mutters:
CHRIS
Uh, Sam?  I'll -- call you back.
He taps the phone, ending the call.  
CHRIS
Joy, I gotta...
JOY
I gotta nothing, Chris, I don’t 
care what excuses he makes.  What 
he did is stealing.
FAVOR GIZMO
GIZMO
And if you play the games Sam gave 
you, it’s like you stole them too.
(innocently)
Isn’t it?
He holds out the helmet.  Chris takes it and considers 
for a beat... 
CHRIS
Awww --
(beat, wavering)
What am I supposed to do?  Sam’s 
my partner in all the toughest 
gaming tournaments.  I mean, we’re 
champions because he’s so good.
Joy looks at him.
JOY
What are you gonna do Chris?
CHRIS
Why do I have to do anything?  I 
just won’t play the games.
JOY
You mean you’re not going to say 
anything?  
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   5.
(MORE)
 You’re just gonna let him keep 
doing it even though you know it’s 
wrong?
SUPERBOOK RISES near the table. 
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Superbook!
A TIME VORTEX OPENS and sucks them in.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Whoas.....
CUT TO:
TIME VORTEX - CONTINUOUS
The kids float through the tunnel.  
SUPERBOOK (V.O.)
I am taking you to meet a man who 
spoke the truth to everyone he 
met, even if that meant putting 
his own life in danger.
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVER JORDAN - (SAME AS TEASER) - DAY
The KIDS AND GIZMO MATERIALIZE behind a large BOULDER on 
the river bank. 
JOHN [MATTHEW 3:7 NLT]
You brood of snakes!
POV - A HULKING SILHOUETTE - appearing more like a bear 
than a man, looms over them, atop the rock with his back 
to the kids.  He is blotting out the sun and obscuring a 
clear view as he bellows:
REVERSE ON JOHN - He stands atop the boulder, looking 
about, wild-eyed, holding a stone in each hand. (The kids 
would be down behind him - behind the boulder - out of 
sight. John is looking towards a large crowd.
JOHN [IBID]
Who warned you to flee God’s 
coming wrath?  Prove by the way 
you live that you have repented of 
your sins and turned to God!
HIGH ON CROWD
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   6.
JOY (CONT'D)
 JOHN [MATTHEW 3:9 NLT] (O.S.)
Don’t just say to each other, 
‘We’re safe, for we are 
descendants of Abraham.’
ON PHARISEES WATCHING
JOHN [IBID]
That means nothing, for I tell 
you...
ON JOHN - He picks up two stone.
JOHN
... God can create children of 
Abraham from these very stones!
ON THE CROWD - Listen and react.
CROWD
Walla of some understanding and 
some questioning) 
BACK ON THE PHARISEES
PHARISEES; #1 nudges #2 forward.
SADDUCEE #2
Some say you are the Messiah.  How 
would you answer?
JOHN - standing atop the boulder, shakes his head.
JOHN [MATTHEW 3:11 NLT]
I baptize with water those who 
repent of their sins and turn to 
God.
He turns to face the civilians - voice building.
JOHN 
But someone is coming soon who is 
greater than I am -- so much 
greater that I’m not worthy even 
to be his slave and carry his 
sandals!
THE PHARISEES - trade disgruntled looks.  
HEROD (O.S.)
Are you referring to me?
UP ANGLE ON JOHN - as he glances off, then scowls. 
REVERSE - The Centurion helps Herod disembark the litter.  
The Soldiers place their hands on their sword hilts.  
Gizmo notices and cowers behind Chris.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   7.
 ON JOHN - eyes narrowing as he addresses Herod.
JOHN
No.  Most definitely not.
THE CROWD MEMBERS - ease backwards.  A few nervously bow.
CROWD
Why is he here? / What do we do? / 
Don’t look at him! / Just bow!
FAVORING HEROD - He beams.  Herodias withdraws from view.
HEROD
You do know who I am, don’t you?
UP ANGLE ON JOHN - nods.
JOHN
Yes. 
(beat, louder)
And I know what shame you bring to 
this holy place!
John accusingly points at the litter, shouting:
JOHN 
It is against God’s law for you to 
take your brother’s wife!
WIDER - He leaps off the rock, addressing the crowd.
JOHN [LEVITICUS 20:21 NLT 
PARAPHRASE]
This is what the Lord told Moses!  
And that is why I say: what they 
have done is an act of impurity!
MEDIUM - Chris, Gizmo and Joy trade wary looks.
GIZMO
Awkward
ON LITTER - The Guards join together creating a small 
force - as though they might move to disperse the crowd.
THE CROWD 
CROWD
<Keep them away from John! / He’s 
a Man of God! / Leave him be! 
(etc.)
WIDE ON LITTER - Herod waves them off with a dismissive 
gesture and climbs into the litter.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   8.
 HEROD
Oh, forget them! - Get us out of 
here -- now!
JOHN STARES DOWN A GUARD - The guard turns away in a 
huff.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They watch the guards depart.
IN THE LITTER
Herodias shoots Herod a deadly glare.
HERODIAS
Are you going to let him get away 
with that?
HEROD
Do you think anyone really listens 
to him, Herodias?  There is 
nothing to be concerned with.
Herodias glowers.  This isn’t finished in her mind.
HIGH DOWN ANGLE
The litter exits frame.
CROWD
<cheers and jeers>
MEDIUM - as the Disciples approach John; he’s calm.
DISCIPLE #1
Teacher, what have you done?
JOHN
I told the truth to a man who 
sinned.
DISCIPLE #2
That man is Herod Antipas, a 
powerful ruler.  He will not 
change his ways. 
JOHN
Then he will be judged by the 
Ruler of Heaven -- and pay a price 
much greater than any we can 
imagine.
He pats Disciple #2’s arm, then heads O.S.  
CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - PUSH IN ON CHRIS
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   9.
 He absorbs this. 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HEROD’S PALACE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT
PUSH IN...
INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Herodias approaches Salome.
HERODIAS
Salome.  The servants have left 
the throne room. Your father is 
alone now.
SALOME
(sigh) Herod is not my father!
HERODIAS
Just do what we rehearsed.
Herodias ushers Salome O.C.
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD’S PALACE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Herod plucks a grape and pops it in his mouth just as 
Herodias SCREAMS from O.C.
HERODIAS
No!
Herod chokes and drops the grapes.
HEROD
(cough-choke)
Herodias storms in, bawling.  Salome follows.
HERODIAS
How can you just sit there?  How 
can you let him do this to me?
CLOSER AT THRONE - He picks up his grapes.
HEROD
Him who?
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   10.
 HERODIAS
John the Baptiser!  He humiliated 
me in public!  Didn’t he, Salome?
SALOME - recites in a monotone: 
SALOME
Oh, yes, the whole city is abuzz.
She saunters to Herod - takes a grape - and exits.  Herod 
watches her with attention - but not leering.
BACK ON HERODIAS - she notes Herod’s attention to Salome.
HEROD (O.C.)
Now-now, Herodias.  
Herodias looks back toward Herod.
BACK ON HEROD
Herod is still looking at O.C. Salome and slowly turns 
his gaze back towards his wife. 
HEROD
No one cares about the ramblings 
of a madman!
ON HERODIAS
HERODIAS
Fine!  Don’t defend me, I’m only 
your wife!  
PUSH IN as Herodias leans close, nose to nose with Herod.  
HERODIAS
But defend yourself!  Every speech 
John makes about his ‘God’ 
undermines your authority!
CLOSE ON HEROD - eyes darting nervously.
HEROD
Hmm.... Yes... I see. Alright.  
I’ll have the Guards arrest the 
Baptiser.  Will that satisfy you?
ON HERODIAS - She looks towards Herodias who is only half 
paying attention to all this.   Then Herodias looks at 
her fingernails is a self-satisfied gesture.
HERODIAS
For now.
DISSOLVE TO:
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   11.
 EXT. RIVER JORDAN - LATER SAME DAY
CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - sit on mats, facing Disciple #1.
DISCIPLE #1
...and that’s when we decided to 
follow John.
CHRIS
Everyone in the crowd who we’ve 
camped with these past few weeks 
has a story just like yours.  But 
weren’t you even a little scared 
of him at first?  I mean, with all 
that hair --
JOY
And the animal skins --
GIZMO
And the preaching?
DISCIPLE #2
(chuckle)
DISCIPLE #1
You have been in the wilderness 
with us long enough... do you not 
agree that John knows how to get 
our attention?  He wants us to 
hear the truth.
(shrugs)
Even when we do not want to 
listen.
TWO SHOT - Joy asides to Chris.
JOY
Sound familiar?
ON GROUP
DISCIPLE #1
You should meet John for 
yourselves.
CHRIS
Okay, but first I got a question 
**
about that thing he does, dunking 
**
people down in the river...
GIZMO cuts him off as his face plate scans an image of  
John baptizing someone.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   12.
 GIZMO
Oh! That is a baptism. Those 
people are turning from sin and 
accepting God’s forgiveness.  
CHRIS
I know that Part, Giz.  What I 
was..
JOHN (O.C.
Anan!
WIDE - John steps up behind Gizmo.  He holds a piece of 
oilcloth, tied together in a knot.  
JOHN
Have you made the new guests feel 
welcome?
DISCIPLE #1
I hope so, Teacher.
John sits and places the oilcloth sack in front of them.
JOHN
Perhaps you would like something 
to eat.
CHRIS - lights up as John opens the sack BELOW FRAME.
CHRIS
That would be awesome, what’s th.. 
(looks down, puzzles)
-- that?
HIS POV - CLOSE ON John’s hands finish unwrapping the 
oilcloth, revealing a dripping piece of HONEYCOMB and 
several CRAWLING LOCUSTS.
CLOSE ON JOHN - as he picks up one of the locusts and 
grins.
JOHN
Honey -- and locusts!
REACTION SHOT - Chris and Joy look askance at one 
another.  Gizmo’s eyes are wide as saucers.
JOY
And... you eat them?
ON JOHN AND DISCIPLE #1 - John places a locust in his 
mouth and both chews. <CRUNCHING SFX>
ON GIZMO
He puts his hand to his mouth and almost gags.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   13.
 GIZMO
(holding back a gag)
JOHN
(chewing)
Yes!  Even here in the desert, the 
Lord provides for us.
ON TRIO - Chris and Joy share a look - then look down at 
the food - both shrug - and reach for the food.
JOY
Sure
CHRIS
I’m game.
JOY
Why not?
CLOSE ON GIZMO - His eyes roll up in his head and he 
keels backward.
GIZMO
<fainting groan>
THUD <SFX>
John and Chris look at Gizmo - shrug to one another - 
then go back to eating the locusts.
X-DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CLEARING BY THE JORDAN RIVER - SUNSET
Chris Joy and Gizmo use nets to try and catch more 
locusts.  John watches and smiles nearby as Gizmo dives 
on  spot in the grass and all the locusts swarm up and 
out. <BZZZZZZ>  - Gizmo pops up and offers a weak smile.
JOHN
(a chuckle)
Disciples #1 and #2 approach.
DISCIPLE #2 [JOHN 3:26 NLT]
Teacher... The man you met on the 
other side of the Jordan River, 
the one you identified as the 
Messiah, is also baptizing people.
DISCIPLE #1 [IBID]
And everybody is going to him 
instead of coming to us!
OUR HEROES - stop chasing bugs and turn to see John say:
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   14.
 JOHN [JOHN 3:28 NLT]
You yourselves know how plainly I 
told you, ‘I am not the Messiah.  
I am only here to prepare the way 
for him.’
RESUME JOHN AND HIS DISCIPLES - as John explains:
JOHN [JOHN 3:29 NLT PARTIAL]
Therefore, I am filled with joy at 
his success.
DISCIPLE #1
But Teacher --
John holds up a hand, silencing him.
JOHN [JOHN 3:30 NKJV)
He must increase and I must 
decrease. 
CUT TO:
EXT. JOHN’S CAMP - NIGHT
A BRIGHT MOON and TWINKLING STARS fill the sky.  TILT 
DOWN TO John and a few Disciples.  They are all asleep.
JOHN / DISCIPLES
<quiet snoring>
CENTURION (O.S.)
There they are!
The kids sit up.
JOY/GIZMO
(gasps of fear)
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CENTURION AND THE SOLDIERS - come 
over a ridge, torches raised, swords in hand.
CENTURION (CONT’D)
Spread out!  Find the Baptiser! 
<walla continues under next lines>
BACK ON THE KIDS and DISCIPLES - They leap to their feet. 
DISCIPLE #1
<gasp>  What should we do?
John stands, but he does not flee.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   15.
 JOHN
Hide in the reeds by the river.
(to Chris and Joy)
Go!  All of you!
JOY AND CHRIS - trade looks of dread, then run off with 
Gizmo.  
John watches them go, then turns toward the approaching 
Soldiers.
AMONGST THE REEDS - Chris, Joy and Gizmo dash PAST 
CAMERA, <SWISH>.  Beat; then the Centurion bursts INTO 
VIEW with torch in hand.  He looks around but doesn’t see 
which way the kids went.
GIZMO
Oh no!
JOY
Go! GO!!
They run off.
JOY
(fearful whimper)
CLOSE ON TRIO - crouching in the reeds.  The nearby 
torch’s light, plays across their fearful faces.  It 
passes away.  The kids look relieved.
CHRIS
(sotto)
What are we going to do? 
JOY
We have to help John!
Suddenly the Superbook light begins to swirl around them.
GIZMO
Too late!
SUPERBOOK SHIMMER envelops them - swirling the BG
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO 
Whoaaa...
EXT. JESUS' ENCAMPMENT - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER - DAY
Our TRIO MATERIALIZES behind a TENT.    CLOSE ON GIZMO - 
checking his wrist monitor. 
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   16.
 GIZMO
It appears that Superbook has 
carried us several months forward 
in time.
CHRIS
Oh no!  We gotta find out what’s 
happened to John! 
Disciple #1 and # approach with camels.
DISCIPLE #2
We have just come from him, 
Children.  He is being held 
prisoner in a cistern below 
Herod’s palace.
They hurry past and approach Jesus and some other men.
DISCIPLE #2 - [MATTHEW 11:3 NLT]
John the Baptizer sent us to ask, 
are you the Messiah we've been 
expecting --
DISCIPLE #1
-- or should we keep looking for 
someone else?
JESUS [MATTHEW 11:4-6 NLT]
Go back to John and tell him what 
you have heard and seen -- 
ON JOY AND CHRIS - reacting to Jesus’s FILTERED VOICE:
JESUS (V.O.)
The blind see, the lame walk, the 
lepers are cured, the deaf hear -- 
the dead are raised to life, and 
the Good News is being preached to 
the poor.
FAVORING JESUS - putting a hand on Anan’s shoulder.
JESUS 
And tell him, ‘God blesses those 
who do not turn away because of 
me.’
As they continue to speak, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO THE 
KIDS...
CHRIS
Come on, guys.  We gotta see what 
we can do to help John!
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   17.
 They dash away.
FADE OUT.

PUSH IN...
SALOME (O.C.)
Mother, John the Baptiser is in 
the dungeon. 
EXT. BALCONY ON HEROD’S PALACE - CONTINUOUS
Herodias stands with Salome.  <O.S. PARTY SOUNDS>  Salome 
is idly swaying to the <MUSIC>.
SALOME
Isn’t that enough?
HERODIAS
No, it is not enough!  In fact, 
now that he’s here, Herod even 
visits with him!  Seems to glad to 
listen to him talking about sin 
and salvation, yet Herod does 
nothing! 
She watches Salome dance absently to the music and 
inspiration strikes.
HERODIAS
But we can do something.
<MUSIC STINGS> as we PUSH IN on Herodias’s smile.
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD’S PALACE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
HOLD ON A WINDOW (no glass or window dividers) at one end 
of the corridor.  Straining, Chris and Joy pull 
themselves through the window...
CHRIS/JOY
(climbing efforts)
They look both ways, then wave out the window.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   18.
 JOY
Hurry, Giz.
CLOSER -Gizmo pulls his torso over the sill and lands, 
<CLUNK>.  Two long FLEXI-CABLES dangle behind him.
GIZMO
<woah-grunt-sigh> Once, just once, 
I’d like to go someplace and walk 
through a door like normal people.
MOVING WITH CHRIS - already sneaking along the hall.  He 
looks back toward Gizmo and Joy, not seeing where he’s 
going.
CHRIS
(sotto)
Keep it down, will you?  We can’t 
afford to get -- unghh...
He bumps into an armor-clad stomach, then looks up.  ZOOM 
OUT FAST to find the Centurion glowering down at him.
CENTURION
‘Caught?’ (lunging sound)
The Centurion lunges at Chris, who leaps up and over his 
lunging grasping arms.
CHRIS
I’m not a big hugger!
CLOSE ON THE CENTURION as he face-plants on the floor.
CENTURION (CONT’D)
<impact grunt>
CHRIS
Run Joy!
END OF HALL - Joy and Gizmo zip down an intersecting 
hall.
THE CENTURION - gets to his feet as SOLDIER #1 runs over.
CENTURION
It’s those children who were with 
the Baptizer!  After them! 
As they race down the corridor in pursuit...

 INT. HEROD’S PALACE - SISTERN-PRISON - NIGHT
A SPUTTERING TORCH at the top of the stairs provides a 
faint light as Chris creeps down a dark and narrow stone 
staircase.  
CENTURION  (O.C.)
Which way did he go?
SOLDIER 1  (O.C.)
I think he headed to the west 
tower.
CENTURION (O.C.)
You go that way.  You two with me!
PUSH IN as Chris he listens fearfully. Then he grabs  
atorch and starts down the dark stairs.  
CHIS
John, are you...
He turns and comes face to face with a RAT on a rock. 
CHRIS
<gasp>!
BIG CLOSE UP - The rat bares it’s teeth with a <SQUEAL> 
and then scampers away.  
BACK ON CHRIS - he clutches his chest going from a wide-
eyed reaction to more relief.  Then a VOICE ECHOES in the 
gloom:
JOHN (O.S.)
Who is there?
NEW ANGLE - Chris hurries over to the CISTERN.  
CHRIS
John?  John, it’s me.  Chris!
CLOSER - John - gaunt. 
JOHN
Come to see John the Baptizer now 
John “the prisoner” did you?
Chris looks aorund.
CHRIS
Don’t say that.  There has to be a 
way to get you out of here!
CLOSE ON JOHN - He shakes his head.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   20.
 JOHN [ISAIAH 40:3 CEV]
The Scriptures told of a messenger 
-- someone shouting, ‘Clear a path 
in the desert!  Make a straight 
road for the Lord our God.’  I am 
the messenger.  Jesus is the Lord.
(beat, quietly)
Now He must increase and I must 
decrease.
Chris shakes his head; with grim resolve:
CHRIS
No, I don’t get it.  But you can 
explain it after I get you outta 
here!
As Chris bolts up the stairs...
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD’S PALACE - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - MEANWHILE - 
NIGHT
O.S. <MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYS> as Joy and Gizmo duck around a 
corner, with backs to the wall and frightened 
expressions.  Joy sees a CURTAINED PORTAL and whispers:
JOY
Quick -- in there!
She dives through the curtains.  Gizmo reacts, shooting 
his neck up and coast is clear, all while dashing after 
her.  They disappear. Just as the curtains settle, the 
Centurion and Soldier #1 round the corner and storm PAST 
CAMERA.
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD’S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
Joy, then Gizmo stumble through the curtains and halt.  
PANIC ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL that they have just crashed 
Herod’s party unseen - near a row of banners on stands
THEIR POV - PAN COUCHES - where OFFICIALS, ARMY OFFICERS 
and LEADERS OF GALILEE lounge.  SLAVES offer them TRAYS 
of FOOD.  MUSICIANS <PLAY MUSIC>.  And finally, we see 
Herod speaking to a guest while Herodias watches him.   
She turns the other way and secretly nods to an O.C. 
Servant. She turns and nods the opposite direction.
ON SERVANT
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   21.
 He nods back at her and then moves to extinguish a torch.  
The room dims.
ON JOY AND GIZMO
They look around as other torches are extinguished.
ANGLE ON THE CROWD
People look around in curiosity. <DANCE MUSIC COMES UP>
HEROD 
looks around
SALOME - dressed in silk, arms writhing slowly like 
serpents, steps into a lone pool of light in the middle 
of the room.  She does a seductive dance.
HEROD
Reacts please - beside him, Herodias watches him watch 
Salome, her plan unfolding perfectly. She smiles a wicked 
smile.
WIDER - The dance ends.  
ON HEROD - beaming.  He bursts into <APPLAUSE>.
HEROD
Wonderful!  Wonderful!
DOWN SHOT - Salome looks up at him from the floor in a 
dance-finished pose.
SALOME
Now what will you do... for me?
CLOSE ON HEROD
HEROD [MARK 6:22-23 CEV]
Ask for anything, and it's yours!  
I swear that I will give you as 
much as half of my kingdom, if you 
want it.
THE GUESTS - trade looks.
GUESTS
(It’s his own daughter./ What’s he 
doing?/This is unheard of.)
ANGLE ON HERODIAS
She and Salome step to one side... and stand in front of 
our heroes’ banner.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   22.
 SALOME [MARK 6:24 CEV] (O.S.)
What do you think I should ask 
for?
Herodias leans in and whispers to Salome.
Salome turns to the throne and announces:
SALOME [MARK 6:25 CEV]
Right now, on a platter -- I want 
the head of John the Baptiser!
THE GUESTS - react, some shocked, some approving.
GUESTS
<sotto walla>
FAVORING HEROD - His satyr’s sneer becomes a sullen pout 
as he turns to Herodias.  She smirks, triumphant.
HEROD [MARK 6:26 CEV PARAPHRASE]
You know I cannot break a promise 
I have made in front of my guests.
(shouts)
Captain?  Captain!
THE CENTURION AND SOLDIER #1 - enter and salute.
CLOSE ON HEROD - as he replies, bitter and resigned:
HEROD [MATTHEW 14:10 CEV]
Go to the prison and cut off 
John’s head.
BEHIND BANNER - Gizmo stare in shock.  Then Joy shakes 
Gizmo out of it and drags him backwards towards the 
curtain where they entered.   
JOY
Come on!  We gotta find Chris!
They turn and bum,p into Chris as he approaches.
CHRIS
(startled yelp) - Joy! I found 
John!
JOY
It’s too late!
GIZMO
Chris!  They are going to cut off 
his head!
CHRIS
WHAT?!  NO!
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   23.
 He races back towards the stairs.  Gizmo and Joy trade 
fretful looks, then follow.
CUT TO:
INT. HEROD’S PALACE - CISTERN - PRISON AREA - NIGHT
The three dash down the stairs where Chris had previous 
seen the rat.  But the hear chains RATTLING and stop 
short. They peer around the corner with care.
The Centurion and Soldier #1 drag John off by his arms.  
CENTURION
Come on, move it!  COME ON!
ON CHRIS - as the men pass by.  He watches, horrified.
CHRIS’S POV - PAN as John locks gazes with Chris.  
OTS OF CHRIS - watching the men carry John into the 
shadows and disappear to do their deed somewhere unseen.
CHRIS
Why does it have to end like this?
Joy leans into Chris CLOSE-UP from behind and places her 
hand on his shoulder consolingly.
JOY
Chris...
Then the Superbook effect appears.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Superbook -- not now!
The BLUE LIGHT FILLS FRAME.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. QUANTUM LAB - MOMENTS LATER - DAY (PRESENT)
The kids return home.  They stare at one another stunned.
GIZMO
Did what I think just happen, 
happen?  Did John...
Chris puts his hand to his neck, lost in thought.  Joy 
nods.  Gizmo sighs and withers, sitting down in defeat.
GIZMO
(sigh)
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   24.
 JOY - kneels and puts a hand on Gizmo’s shoulder. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS

matter what the consequences were. 
Chris has a thought - and turns to look at --

EXT. SAM’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER - DAY
Sam opens his front door and reacts.  ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo standing before him.
SAM
Oh, hey, Chris.  You like those 
new games? 
CHRIS
I... told Gizmo to delete them.
SAM
What?  You had no right to do 
that!
Chris stands up to Sam.
CHRIS
No, you had no right, sam.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS
You know what?  Stealing is 
stealing, whether you download a 
bootleg or walk in a store and 
stuff a copy in your pocket. - I 
can be your friend but I won’t be 
your game partner if you’re going 
to steal and cheat. And that’s the 
truth.
Chris turns and walks down the steps.  SAM glares.
SAM
(seeming contrite)
Hey maybe what I did wasn’t 
‘truthful.’ 
Chris stops by Joy and Gizmo.  They turn - thinking Sam 
is about to apologize.  Then he shows his true colors.
      SB 206P "Nothing but the Truth" REV. ANICON Draft  5-28-12   25.
 SAM
But I got the best games in school 
before anyone else.  HA!
Sam <SLAMS> the door.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - they wince back from the 
reverberation of the door <SLAM> - Joy and Gizmo slowly 
look at Chris.  He keeps looking at the closed door.
GIZMO
Ya know... I think I am starting 
to understand why John had to 
shout so loud sometimes. 
CHRIS
Yeah.  That could be what it takes 
to get through to some people.  
But, for now, let’s just give Sam 
some time to figure this out on 
**
his own. 
They turn and walk away from Sam’s house.
