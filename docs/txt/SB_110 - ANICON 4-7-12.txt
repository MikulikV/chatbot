SYNOPSIS: - Chris and his band have been invited to audition for an American 
Idol-like show, called World's Best Band. The “success” goes to Chris' head 
and he becomes comically unbearable to live with; he is becoming a Superstar 
in his own mind and he wants Joy and Gizmo to treat him accordingly. 
SUPERBOOK whisks the kids off to Jerusalem as Jesus is making his triumphant 
entrance.  Chris is enamored with the fame Jesus seems to have, with the 
crowds cheering Him, with the “entourage” of disciples around him, and with 
the fact that everyone is talking about Jesus becoming King! However, through 
the course of his journey, which culminates at the Last Supper, Chris comes 
to learn how wrong he is about his attitudes about power and fame.  He sees 
in Jesus a focus on humility and service that touches him deeply.  Chris, Joy 
and Gizmo ultimately return home and Chris has a major shift in his attitude 
as he now begins to help his band members instead of lording his “fame” over 
them.  Humility and service become his goals, instead of fame and fortune.
TAKE-AWAY: God will bless those who serve others.

                         PROLOGUE
FADE IN:
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
CAMERA STARTS ON THE BACK OF JESUS AND SLOWLY ARCS UP TO 
REVEAL THE CROWD.  He’s facing a CROWD. We stay close 
enough that we reveal perhaps 10 or 12 of what is clearly 
a much larger crowd beyond the SIDES OF FRAME. <SOUND MIX 
TO INDICATE 100 or more>
CROWD
1
[Upbeat Cheering... RECORD ENOUGH 
TO MIX THROUGH THE FOLLOWING 
SCENE)
Jesus raises his hands to calm them but they continue to 
cheer and <APPLAUD>. 
CUT TO DOWN ANGLE OF JESUS ADDRESSING THE CROWD.  THE 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL NASHON AND MARIANUS.
EXT. A BLUFF ABOVE THE FIELD - CONTINUOUS
<CHEERING AND CROWD> somewhat diminished by the distance. 
NAHSHON (O.S.)
2
See how his following has grown? 
CAMERA FINDS NAHSHON, a temple leader, and MARIANUS, a 
Roman Centurion, watching from the cover of an olive 
tree.- A hundred yards down the embankment in front of 
them - they see the true size of the crowd following 
Jesus. (PROD NOTE: Obscure the immenseness of the crowd 
with strategically placed tree branches in shot and tents 
down by Jesus, etc. But the gathering must look sizeable.
NAHSHON (CONT’D) 
3
Now, they are even claiming Jesus 
can raise the dead.  
 MARIANUS
4
If this rabbi is more popular than 
you and the other temple leaders, 
that is your problem, Nahshon.  
(chuckle) not Rome's.
He turns from the bluff.  Nahshon follows...
WIDE ON THE TWO AS MARIANUS WALKS TO HIS HORSE.
NAHSHON
5
But some are calling Jesus the 
messiah, the savior of the people.
Marianus reaches his HORSE.
CLOSE ON MARIANUS
MARIANUS
6
You are over-reacting.  
NAHSHON reaches out and places a hand on Marianus’ 
shoulder as though to turn him around.
CLOSE ON MARIANUS - he freezes and raises an eyebrow, 
eyeing the hand on his shoulder with a cocked head.  
Nahshon leans in closer, speaking confidentially
NAHSHON
7
If they start calling him king, 
there will be a rebellion.  
(a pause for dramatic 
effect - rasing an 
eyebrow)
Isn't that Rome's problem?
OTS OF NAHSHON ON MARIANUS - He registers the thought - 
then he steps away and turns
DOWN ANGLE ON JESUS
MARIANUS steps into frame, looking back down the hill - 
lost in thought - perhaps a little more concerned than 
before.

The door bursts open.  Joy storms in and stops - arms 
akimbo.  An Asian boy, (WILL - 12) is carrying a large 
amplifier approaches.  Joy can’t see his face because of 
the size of the amp and assumes it is Chris.

Chris, you were supposed to be in 
the library an hour ago!  What are

ON JOY as she steps out of the way and WILL responds as 
he passes by.

CHRIS
20
King of “Rock and Roll” sounds 
good.  
(stops bouncing 
glasses - lies back 
again)
Yeah - it’s good to be king.  
As a superstar, I have to keep my 
distance from the...
(looking at JOY over 
his sunglasses)
... “lesser band members.” 
(pointing at JOY)
You understand.
(lying back again - 
normal voice)
A little faster, Gizmo.

My geo-sensors indicate we are in 
Bethany, a small town a couple of 
miles from Jerusalem.  Time: The 
first century.
<BEEPING SFX> Gizmo’s POV arrives on PETER who is 
addressing a small crowd. Graphics “triangulate” in on 
Peter who holds a small basket in each hand. One is 
filled with loaves and another with dried fishes.

quite a crowd.  Here, listen in.
