 ABRAHAM
13
No, I insist on paying for my 
wife’s burial place.

them to Ephron. 
EPHRON
14
As you wish.  You are indeed a man 
of honor. 
EXT. CAVE OF MACHPELAH - DAY

forklift, move under the crate.

This might be my Dad’s best 
invention yet.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (V.O.)
26
I hope so, Chris.
ANGLE PROFESSOR QUANTUM - entering the backyard. He 
unfurls a life-sized schematic showing a robotic exo-
skeleton.  
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
27
With my new exo-skeleton anybody 
will able to lift heavy objects.
ANGLE FAVORING GIZMO - looking at the schematic, dubious.
GIZMO
28
Excuse me... ahem... I think you 
already have a robot who does 
that.
ANGLE CHRIS - excitedly trying to put the pieces 
together.   Professor Quantum ENTERS FRAME.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
29
Not so fast, Chris.  First, I have 
to go to the lab and calibrate the 
motion sensors.
CHRIS
30
Can’t we start doing something?
ANGLE FAVORING JOY - as she approaches them.
JOY
31
Chris is bouncing off the walls, 
Professor.  Or would be if we 
weren’t in the backyard.
ANGLE FAVORING PROFESSOR QUANTUM - handing Chris a box.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
32
<LAUGHS>  Okay. Chris, you 
remember the procedure for 
assembling the motherboard?  
                       SB - ISAAC AND REBEKAH - TR DRAFT -          5
 CHRIS
33
I can do that in my sleep. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
34
You need to follow the protocol 
exactly.  Safety measures, the 
whole nine yards.
ANGLE ON CHRIS - already going at the motherboard with 
high tech TOOL, barely paying attention.  
CHRIS
35
Of course. Right.  No problem.
WIDER - Professor Quantum exits.
ANGLE ON JOY - studying the schematic.  She holds it up 
to Chris.
JOY
36
Chris, Don’t you need this? 
WIDER ON CHRIS AND JOY - he looks up, shakes his head.
CHRIS
37
I re-configured my holo-helmet and 
unlocked eighteen levels of Ninja 
Warrior.  Didn’t look a the 
instructions once.  
Chris starts messing with the motherboard.  Joy frowns.
JOY
38
But your Dad said to follow the 
protocol.  
CHRIS
39
That’s gonna take forever.  I know 
what I’m doing, Joy.  Right, 
Gizmo?
ANGLE ON GIZMO - comparing a robotic hand to his own. 
GIZMO
40
Well, when you repaired my nav 
system, it took me an hour to find 
the kitchen... otherwise... 
ANGLE JOY - taking the schematic to Chris.
JOY
41
There’s a reason your father made 
those safety protocols.

Ahh!  Look out!
ANGLE CHRIS AND ANOTHER CRATE - a mechanical leg shoots 
out, knocking Chris back.  
WIDER ANGLE - as the two pieces slide across the yard, 
knocking over a TRASH CAN and a PICNIC TABLE, then smash 
into each other -- forming the beginnings of a body!  
ANGLE GIZMO - as he runs for cover, part of a LEG ZOOMS 
over his head.  Gizmo collapses his body, making himself 
small. 
GIZMO
43
Big is not necessarily better!
ANGLE TORSO - spinning around, an arm attaching itself to 
where leg should be. 
ANGLE HAND - flying across the yard, knocking over a PILE 
OF BRICKS which go flying.  
ANGLE TORSO - which now has assembled various limbs all 
horribly out of place forming a Tim Burtonesque 
transformer. 
ANGLE JOY AND CHRIS - watching the disaster.
JOY
44
Chris, do something!
CHRIS
45
I did. Just not what I meant to...
ANGLE EXO-SKELETON - one arm and hand where a leg should 
be, the skeleton hops around the yard.
ANGLE JOY - ducking the out-of-control skeleton.

skeleton.

Something terrible must have 
happened to that guy.

in on certain areas of the field.
GIZMO
59
Alert.  My database says we’ve 
been here before.  But biomass 
decay indicates time has passed.  
WIDER - as SUPERBOOK appears from Joy’s pocket.  
JOY

 JOY
61
I remember him.  That’s Isaac.  
CHRIS
62
Right.  God intervened and stopped 
Abraham from sacrificing him.
JOY
63
Because Abraham showed himself to 
be a man of complete faith.  I’ll 
never forget that.
WIDER - the hologram disappears.  They look over at 
Isaac.
JOY
64
He’s so much older.  And so much 
sadder.
CHRIS

ABRAHAM (V.O.)

My heart is broken.  How can I?
Abraham regards his son, moved by his plight. 
ABRAHAM
77
I believe you must marry and start 
a family of your own.  
Isaac looks up at him.

Do you really think there is a 
woman I was meant to be with?

Yes.  And with God’s help, we will 
find her.

since I last did that.  I haven’t 
lost my touch.
ANGLE FAVORING ELIEZER - Abraham enters. 
ELIEZER
82
Look, Master.  These young 
shepherds have gathered Isaac’s 
sheep. 
Abraham turns to the kids. 
ABRAHAM
83
Thank you.  You are welcome to 
take a meal at my home. 
ANGLE ON ABRAHAM AND ELIEZER - Abraham turns to him.
ABRAHAM
84
It came to me, Eliezer.  At last I 
know how to help Isaac.  He will 
only be happy when he has a wife.
ANGLE KIDS - who trade a LOOK. 
ABRAHAM (V.O.)

When I mentioned this to him, I 
could see it in his eyes. He 
looked hopeful.  
ANGLE ABRAHAM
ABRAHAM

And you must help him find the 
right one.
ANGLE ABRAHAM AND ELIEZER 
ELIEZER

from among the women of Hebron?
                       SB - ISAAC AND REBEKAH - TR DRAFT -          12
 ABRAHAM

heaven and earth, that you will 
not allow my son to marry one of 
these Canaanite women. (NLT Gen 
24:3)
ANGLE FAVORING ELIEZER.
ELIEZER

ABRAHAM
90
You shall go to my country and to 
my family and take a wife for my 
son, Isaac. (NKJV Gen 24:4)
ELIEZER
91
Perhaps the woman will not be 
willing to follow me to this land.  
Must I take Isaac back to the land 
from which you came? (NKJV Gen 
24:5)  
ANGLE ABRAHAM - he bangs his staff hard on the ground, 
startling the sheep which scatter. 
ABRAHAM
92
No!  Be careful never to take my 
son there! (NLV Gen 24:6)
ANGLE ON KIDS - REACTING.

93
So, I guess that’s a no.  
Gizmo looks at the scattered sheep.

94
And I guess we’re back to 
gathering sheep. 
RESUME ABRAHAM AND ELIEZER - as they survey the land 
before them.

not take my son back there. (NKJV 
Gen 24:8)
ANGLE ON KIDS - watching.  In the b.g. Gizmo continues to 
attempt to round up sheep, zipping back and forth.

98
Okay, that sounds like a plan.  Go 
where Abraham’s tribe is, find 
Isaac a wife.  
(calling)
Gizmo!  Where is Abraham from, 
anyway?  
Gizmo zips over.
GIZMO
99
According to my data base, he’s 
from Haran in Mesopotamia.  Over 
six hundred miles from here. 
(EXACT MILES?)

And I have faith that He will.

Patience is not one of Chris’ 
strong points.
