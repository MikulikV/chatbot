FADE IN:
EXT. TOWER OF BABEL WORK AREA - AFTERNOON
*
PULL BACK TO REVEAL  a stack of brick in the shape of a 
*
small tower.  WORKERS raise the bricks on a pallet and 
*
exit frame.  
*
(PRODUCTION NOTES: THE TOWER OF BABEL will be a 
*
magnificent structure that reaches hundreds of feet - 
*
almost but not quite - to the clouds.  Another half mile 
*
around the towers we see a city as a backdrop.  (We don’t 
*
use the city in the episode.) 
*
SPECIFIC AREAS BEING DEPICTED - (later scenes) - PEOPLE 
*
(no slave/slave-driver scenarios) work in accord, in the 
*
work site/staging area around the base of the tower.  
*
Others move up and down the ramps that spiral up around 
*
the tower. Some workers carry building stones/bricks on 
*
pallets, or in baskets on their backs.  Some carry 
*
vessels of asphalt on their shoulders. Some might pour 
*
vessels of steaming asphalt where bricks are being laid 
*
up. In the work area below, there could be large, 
*
fiery/smoking kilns for brick making. (Can we use the 
*
kiln model from Babylon - perhaps with a new texture map 
*
applied. Please check.) 
*
THE KILN AREA - The kiln fire <ROARS> big in frame.  
*
WORKERS put finished bricks from a large stack into 
*
baskets. Other workers can pass in the BG but keep their 
*
faces from being seen - turned away or carrying baskets 
*
on their shoulders, etc. LIMIT NEED TO DESIGN MANY 
*
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
*
*
ACTION CONTINUES - THE LEADER (originally described as 
*
NIMROD - CBN requests we don’t use that name for accuracy 
*
 reasons), THE AIDE and the THE ARCHITECT walk through the 
*
workers.
*
AIDE

*
They have built them up one upon

UPSHOT ON THE LEADER, ARCHITECT AND AIDE.
*
The architect gestures proudly, expansively.

This is the greatest monument the

*
It is an achievement that will 
*
unify our people… keep them from 
*
scattering abroad, over the face 
*
of the earth… 
*
OTS - LEADER, ARCHITECT AND AIDE
*
We now see a massive staircase in front of them, leading 
*
up into the tower. As he continues speaking, CAMERA 
*
ANGLES UPWARDS, REVEALING the impressive TOWER OF BABEL 
*
reaching into the clouds.
*
LEADER

*
And everyone who comes to the land 
*
of Shinar will fall to their 
*
knees, in awe of what we have 
*
accomplished.  
*
DRAMATIC DOWN SHOT
*
The Leader looks up towards to the very top of the tower.

MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL and another ANGEL land atop the

the conversation with concern - then they turn their gaze 
to the tower -

Are these people trying to build a 
tower to reach Heaven?
*
Michael shakes his head - he doesn’t know. Then he leaps 
*
down to a lower area of the tower for a closer look.

I wonder what God will do?

Then they flap their powerful wings and soar up towards

FADE IN:
EXT. QUANTUM BACKYARD - DAY
A portable soccer goal/net is set up in the grass area.  
*
Suddenly, a soccer ball explodes into the net - punching 
it backwards with great force. <WHISSSHH-THUD>  
CHRIS (O.C.)
10
GOOOAAAAALLLL! 
VEER (O.C.)
11
(Hindi translation

GOOOOOAAAAAAL!!
LOW ANGLE - CHRIS dashes into the goal. He back-rolls the 
ball with his toe - flicks it up - bounces it off his 
knee and catches it as the O.C. chatter continues...

 JOY (O.C.)

All right!  Nice shot, Chris!  
ANGLE ADJUSTS TO INCLUDE JOY rushing up with VEER, a 
likeable, upbeat Hindi boy their age. VEER SPEAKS ONLY IN

VEER
13
(IN Hindi)
*
That was brilliant, Chris!  If all 
players at Valleyview are as good 
as you, I’ll have to work twice as 
hard to make the team this week!
Veer playfully kicks the ball out of Chris’ hand and it 
pops upwards so he can “head” it O.C.  Then Veer dashes 
O.C. after the ball.
VEER
14
(IN Hindi)
*
(laughing) - My turn now!
A beat -
CHRIS
15
(calling after)
Uh-- yeah, whatever you say, Veer.
Chris steps next to Joy and they both look O.C.
CHRIS
16
Joy, how are we gonna to teach him 
*
our team’s plays when we can’t 
understand a word we say to each 
other? 
PUSH IN ON JOY as she looks O.C. and considers...
JOY
17
It must be pretty hard for him. I 
mean, his family moves here... all 
the way from India... 
THEIR POV - Across the yard, Veer is doing some fancy 
maneuvers with the soccer ball. He’s very good. Kicking 
it up... bouncing it with his head.
JOY (O.C.)
18
... he starts a new school... 
doesn’t know anybody... can’t 
speak our language... 
VEER traps the ball with a slam down of his foot - and 
calls back toward Chris and Joy.

What do you think he’s saying?
CHRIS
21
Could be anything. 
(calling)
Hey Veer!  We’re gonna light our 
pants on fire and do belly flops 
into the pool from the lab roof.  
You want in?  
ON VEER
*
He looks up where Chris is pointing - has no idea what 
*
he’s just said - and happily waves back to his new 
*
friend.
*
ON JOY AND CHRIS
*
Joy slaps Chris on the shoulder.
JOY
22
Chris!!  That’s rude!
CHRIS

Here it comes!
Veer’s FOOT ENTERS FRAME and gives the ball a mighty 
<KICK>  
The ball shoots O.C. On a low rising trajectory.
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY - They react as the ball shoots 
towards them.
CHRIS/JOY
25
Whoa!/Yelp!
They both dive O.C. in opposite directions  
CLOSE ON NET
     Superbook #213 "One Voice" - Anicon Draft 01-19-15    5  
 The ball explodes into the net, shooting up and out the 
GAP at the top of the net.  This allows the ball to 
continue OFF OVER THE QUANTUM YARD FENCE.
ON JOY - She sits up in awe.
JOY
26
Wow!  Great shot, Veer!  
ON CHRIS  
*
He sits up and looks a little more upset.  Veer runs INTO 
FRAME and pulls Chris to his feet, excited explaining...
VEER
27
(in Hindi)
*
Chris!  I’m sorry!  I kicked it 
too hard for this yard.  Don’t 
worry, I’ll get it. 
He dashes out of the yard.
VEER (O.C.)
28
Be right back!  Then we’ll go over 
the rest of your plays!  
TRACKING SHOT - Chris stomps towards the house. 
CHRIS
29
That does it!
Joy falls in right behind him.
CHRIS
30
Gizmo’s gotta translate for us!
JOY
31
But you said Giz was doing updates 
and diagnostics all day!
They head off.

CUT TO:
INT. QUANTUM LAB - CONTINUOUS - DAY
GIZMO sits with his chest, head, and arm-device opened.  
Multi-colored lasers run from a pad computer into his 
*
various open body part and devices.  His Faceplate 
displays falling codes. <LOW BEEPING SFX>  Chris and Joy 
storm in.
CHRIS
32
Let’s get you back online, Giz. We 
need an interpreter.
     Superbook #213 "One Voice" - Anicon Draft 01-19-15    6  
 Chris pulls off the wires as Gizmo’s face reappears on 
his screen.
JOY
33
Chris, you’re canceling all his 
updates? 
CHRIS
34
Veer speaks Hindi, Joy!  It’s a 
language that’s like over a 
thousand years old.
(finishing with the 
wires)
I think Gizmo’s gonna have all the 
translations we need without his 
latest updates.  
Gizmo comes to.
GIZMO
35
Oh, hello, Chris.  Hello Joy.  
He jumps to his feet - does a comical spin, happy to be 
*
back online - and then looks at the computer pad and 
*
disconnected lasers suspiciously.
*
GIZMO
36
Chris, it appears you have

cancelled my download session 
before it was completed.  That

37
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Never mind that,

opposite sides of the brick stack. The tower base wall is 
behind them as well as a series of tools and building 
paraphernalia.  Gizmo’s head rises about a foot high over 
the center of the brick stack.  <O.C. WORK WALLA)

Long pause - trying to understand...

CHRIS
109
Yeah... But why would God change

everyone’s language and... and 
*
cause all that confusion? 
*
JOY
110
*
They were building that tower to

glorify themselves.  So... if

could do a thing like that - maybe

there was no telling what other

things they might try to do to

prove how great they were.  
Another pause as Chris absorbs this...

The servant suddenly shifts to speaking in a hushed,

energized tone. Chris glances in the door as the servant 
*
closes it.  Inside, he sees a brief image of people 
*
sitting, kneeling, talking in close huddles. We can’t 
*
tell at this point but it is the eleven disciples, Mother 
*
Mary and Mary Magdalen, etc. The door shuts.  
*

121

Please, you must tell me. Were you

among those with Jesus when he

died?  And when he rose from the

men will see visions and your old

Shall be saved. This Jesus God has

CLOSE ON A PIZZA BOX - It flips open revealing a killer 
pie - steaming hot and loaded with extras.
WIDEN OUT T REVEAL Chris, Joy, Gizmo, Professor Quantum, 
Phoebe, Veer and Veer’s Mother and Father are seated and 
standing around the picnic table.  The table is filled 
with picnic supplies and food.  It’s a feast.

(Happy walla in English and 
Hinglish from Veer)

PROFESSOR QUANTUM

(good natured)
Gizmo, I think you better turn on 
your translator module.  Veer 
*
seems to be saying something very 
*
important.
*
GIZMO
174
I am sorry, professor.  Chris has 
given me explicit instructions NOT 
to translate.
CHRIS
175
That’s right, dad!  Veer and I are 
talkin’ the universal language of 
FOOD!
He raises a slice in the air.  Veer gets the cue and does 
the same as they shout.
CHRIS

*
Go! Pizza!

VEER

Go! Pizza!

 The race is on!  Chris and Veer stuff the pizza’s towards 
their mouth like 12 year old boys will do, in mad dash to 
see who can finish first.
EVERYONE

(fun protests from parents... Joy 
saying “Chris!  So Gross!” - Boys

chomping)
ON GIZMO

GIZMO

*
Just because I can’t translate 
*
doesn’t mean we can’t listen in 
*
any language we want.
*
The Flutter-Giz-Cam flies out of his chest.
*
GIZMO
181
*
I‘ve reconfigured the Flutter-Giz-
*
Cam with a portable microphone and  
*
language translator.  Watch.  Or 
*
better yet - listen.
*
The Flutter-Giz-Cam flies up to Chris and pops out its 
*
mic.
*
CHRIS

*
Mmm... This is the best pizza 
*
ever. Veer, how many slices do you 
*
think we can eat?  There are three 
*
whole pizza pies here but we can 
*
order out for more.  The Veggie 
*
Pie is my favorite.  What about 
*
you? (laughter)
*
As Chris is speaking the Flutter-Giz-Cam translates into 
*
HINDI simultaneously. (Starting around 21:01:18)

day.  Pass the pizza please.
