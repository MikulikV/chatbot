CBN TAKEAWAY: You can find forgiveness and restoration with friends no matter 
how big your mistake.
SYNOPSIS
Chris is desperate to play with some of the cooler kids in school 
in an afternoon pick-up basketball game.  Just as he demonstrates 
his Quantum Corkscrew jump shot, Joy runs in to excitedly announce 
that she's been elected Chess Club President!  Realizing how un-
cool that sounds to the guys he's trying to impress, Chris 
pretends he doesn't know her.  Gizmo promptly arrives with Chris' 
sneakers, but there will be no game for him today.  Instead, 
Superbook sends the trio back in time to meet the disciple Peter, 
who ends up denying Jesus three times.  Later, after seeing the 
risen Jesus forgive Peter on the shores of Galilee, Chris realizes 
that like Peter, he was acting out of fear when he refused to 
acknowledge Joy's friendship.  Once the kids return to the 
present, Chris takes a pass on the pick-up game and heads off with 
his true friends to celebrate Joy's accomplishment.

INT. LAST SUPPER ROOM - JERUSALEM - DAY [RE-USE #110]
ALL THE DISCIPLES EXCEPT JUDAS ARE PRESENT at the table.  
*
JESUS sits silently, listening to the chatter.  John is at 
*
His right.  Thomas is across the table. [Suggested by Luke 
*
22:24-27 NKJV]:

CLOSER ANGLE - TRACKING PETER TO THE TABLE as...

JOHN

But Thomas, I am the one He looks 
*
to first.
Thomas looks up as Peter approaches.

THOMAS

Tell him, Simon Peter.  Jesus

speaks to me like a father to his 
son.
PETER

(chuckling)
*
You’re both wrong. I am the one 
Jesus favors!

 He slowly looks up and listens.

THOMAS (O.C.)

*
Simon Peter, how can you say that?  
*
What makes you think you are that 
*
important to Jesus?
*
PETER

*
(Chuckle)
*
JESUS [LUKE 22:25 NLT]
7
*
In this world the kings and great 
men lord it over their people...
(the O.C. Discussion 
subsides)
... yet they are called ‘friends of 
the people. But among you it will 
be different. Those who are the 
*
greatest among you should take the 
*
lowest rank...
*
PAN THE DISCIPLES - a bit confused by his words.
JESUS (O.S.) [LUKE 22:26 NLT]
8
... and the leader should be like a 
*
servant. 
BACK ON JESUS
JESUS [LUKE 22:25 NLT

Who is more important, the one who 
sits at the table or the one who 
serves? 
ON THE DISCIPLES
JESUS (O.C.)
10
*
The one who sits at the table, of 
course. But not here! 
CLOSE ON JESUS
JESUS (CONT’D)

For I am among you as one who 
serves. - 
ON PETER then panning group
*
JESUS (CONT’D)
12
*
And just as my Father has granted 
me a Kingdom, I now grant you the 
right to eat and drink at my table 
in my Kingdom. And you will sit on 
thrones, judging the twelve tribes 
of Israel.

ON JESUS
*
Jesus calmly transitions with just a look to Peter.
JESUS [LUKE 22:31 NKJV)
14
Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has 
asked for you, that he may sift you 
as wheat. But I have prayed for 
*
you, that your faith should not 
fail; and when you have returned to 
Me, strengthen your brethren.” 
ON PETER - He rises.
*
PETER [LUKE 22:33 NLT]
15
Lord, I am ready to go to prison 
with you, and even to die with you!
ON JESUS
*
Jesus rises to face Peter as he approaches.
JESUS [LUKE 22:34 NLT]
16
Peter... Before the rooster crows 
*
tomorrow morning, you will deny 
three times that you even know me.
SLOW PUSH IN CLOSE ON Peter - his reaction slowly shifts from 
assuredness - to questioning - to being aghast - all as the 
<MUSIC BUILDS> and we begin to FADE OUT and...

ACT ONE
EXT. VALLEY VIEW SCHOOL - DAY (PRESENT) [RE-USE]
A SHOT ESTABLISHES the school.  Then GIZMO <ZIPS> down the

CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY (PRESENT) [RE-USE]

 CHRIS
17
I’m just saying, I’d like to... you 
know, maybe get into one of your 
pick-up games after school some 
time. 
*
Player #2 shoots as he says - with attitude...
STUDENT #2
18
(snicker) Quantum, our game’s 
“Invite Only”.
CLOSE ON THE BALL as it <SWISHES> cleanly through the net. It 
comes down and <BOUNCES> as Chris bounds INTO FRAME - grabs 
it - whips it behind his back - and brings it back down into 
a solid dribble, as he heads back to the guys, saying...
CHRIS
19
Everybody knows that.  So what’s it 
take to get an invite?
BACK ON THE STUDENTS - TOP OF KEY - Chris ends up in front of 
them and does a quick-fancy between-the-legs dribble and body 
pivot, - as he flips the ball up letting it spin on his 
raised forefinger.  The Students exchange a look of surprise 
at Chris’ impudence.
STUDENT #2
20
(Derisive snort) We don’t hang with 
guys like you, Quantum.  Not cool 
*
and too short. (laughs)
Student #2 knocks the ball away from Chris and bounce passes 
*
it to Student #1.
*
STUDENT #1
21
(snicker) Oh, I dunno.  I heard 
*
Quantum here has a wicked “little” 
jump shot.
ON CHRIS  AND STUDENT #2
*
#2 looks at Chris derisively.
*
STUDENTS #2
22
Yeah, “Little” is right.
He exits as Chris gets angry.
*
STUDENT #1 AND STUDENT #2 (O.C.)

CLOSE ON CHRIS
He moves fast and steals the bouncing ball...

*
(basketball playing/grabbing walla)
*
CHRIS
25
I call it the Quantum Corkscrew.
TRACKING CHRIS - He dribbles round them and heads out to the 
*
3-Point Line - Chris keeps dribbling and passes the ball 
*
under one leg, then the other - with his back to the basket - 
pivots left with a bounce - right with a bounce - then jumps 
up, spins 180 degrees in mid-air and shoots with an 
incredibly light flick of the wrists. 
CLOSE ON BALL - arcing - and <SWISH> through the net
QUICK CUT - Chris lands and does a knee-dip and fist pump.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
26
*
Awright!
*
THE STUDENTS - gape for a beat - then...
STUDENT #2
27
Do that again so we know it’s not a 
*
fluke!
ON CHRIS -(Near entry door)
*
CHRIS
28
Ha... I drop that shot in my sleep. 
*
The gym door opens. Joy dashes in excited:
*
JOY
29
Chris!  Chris, you’ll never guess 
what!  I got elected President of 
the Chess Club!  
*
STUDENT #1 and #2 - break out in derisive laughter.
STUDENT #1 AND STUDENT #2
30
*
(laughter)
*
STUDENT #1
*
(overplaying)
Seriously?  Chess club? Oh my 
gosh I’m president!! 
(laughing)
STUDENT #2

(Laughing)

STUDENT #2
31
Quantum, you know this chess-nut?
ON CHRIS AND JOY beneath the basket - He looks from the

 CHRIS
33
Uh--Never seen her before.  Check 
*
this out, guys!
He hurries away from Joy, dribbling the basketball.  She 
takes a half step back in stunned silence. 
JOY
34
(softly)
Chris?
JOY’S POV - Chris is dribbling around the two guys at the top 
of the key. (lots of fun and “hooting-grabbing”)
STUDENT #1/#2/CHRIS
35
(playful basketball ad-libbing - 
*
Not bad look at the moves, etc.)
*
Then Chris dashes for mid court, - does his Corkscrew moves - 
jump spins - shoots up O.C. towards the basket. 
TRACKING THE BALL - Another arc and SWISH through the net.  
But when the ball <BOUNCES> down below the basket we see 
Joy’s back just exiting the Gym as the door closes behind 
her.
ON CHRIS
*
He hears the door shut and looks... but then Student #1 
*
rushes.
*
STUDENT #1
36
Personal invite to the game. 
*
Student #1 offers him a fist bump.  Chris takes a beat then 
*
catches on.
*
CHRIS
37
*
Huh? Oh... (makes verbal explosion 
*
sound on fist bump) 
*
Student #1 and #2 head towards the locker room doors - NOT to *
the exit of the gym.
STUDENT #2
38
Meet you at River Park.
*
PUSH IN ON CHRIS - a small victorious fist pump/knee dip.
CHRIS
39
Yes!
GIZMO (O.C.)
40
Chris!  Oh, Chris! 
Chris turns as Gizmo hurries in the gym door, holding a pair 
of sneakers. Chris dashes to him as...

 GIZMO (CONT’D)
41
I have brought your athletic shoes 
from home like you asked.  
*
Chris arrives near Gizmo at the gym door, cutting him off... 
CHRIS
42
Giz, I’m gonna be hanging with the 
*
coolest kids at Valley View!
GIZMO
43
I am very glad for you, Chris.  
*
But... uh... what is the matter 
*
with Joy?
Gizmo leans out the gym door and points.   Chris looks to 
*
see:
OUTSIDE - Joy stands dabbing her eyes with a tissue.  She 
*
looks up and starts towards them:
JOY
44
Chris... How could you do that?   
*
TWO SHOT - Chris and Gizmo step from the gym into the hall.  
The gym door closes. 
CHRIS
45
Joy, those guys don’t think the 
Chess Club is very cool and you 
know how much I want to...
SIDE ANGLE - Joy stops - looking shocked. 
JOY
46
(hurt, confused)
And that makes it okay to pretend 
you don’t know me?
CLOSE - Chris is busted, but nevertheless he protests:
CHRIS
47
Joy, you know I’m your friend.
*
She stares at him.  A tear trickles down her cheek.
JOY
48
I thought I knew.  
She turns to walk away.  
CHRIS
49
Joy!... Jo---oooy.
*
The SUPERBOOK FX begins.  Joy whirls as...

Gizmo panics.
*
GIZMO

him from Joy and Gizmo.

the first Temple Guards at the gate)
CHRIS
59
What’s going on?
The man turns and nods to Jesus.
TEMPLE GUARD #1
60

This man, Jesus of Nazareth, is 
stirring up all kinds of trouble 
claiming he’s the son of God!  
ON PETER NEARBY

He looks around in fear 
*
TEMPLE GUARD #1 (CONT’D)

64
Hey... wait... what are

IN THE CROWD
*
Peter hesitates and John moves forward with the others.

John is already at the aget when he notices Peter has stalled *
behind.

He’s pushed along by the crowd.

*
Chris gets inside. SERVANT GIRL #1 shuts the gate as...

68
John!
The gate slams shut on Peter.  He turns and see two guards 
*
glaring at him.
*
EXT. CAIAPHAS’ COURTYARD - 
*
John stops - looks at Jesus (ahead of him) being hustled into *
the house - then he turns and looks back at the Servant Girl 
*
#1 barring the gate.  He races back to her. 
*
JOHN

Please.  Let my friend in.

 Peter rushes in and grabs John’s shoulder.
*
PETER
71
*
John, this is all going badly.
*
John keeps moving across the courtyard.
*
JOHN
72
*
Hurry!  There is no time to delay!
*
Peter appears shaken as he is hustled forward by John towards *
the still open door of the house.  TEMPLE GUARD #2 and 
*
SERVANT GIRL #2 are by the open door - peering inside at the 
*
UNSEEN activity. 
*
Peter suddenly pulls John to a stop in the middle of the 
*
courtyard - his panic growing.
*
PETER
73
*
LISTEN TO ME!  
*
John is startled by Peter’s vehemence.  Peter’s eyes dart 
*
around at the others - a couple of guards pass and look at 
*
them before moviong off.  Peter turns back to John, voice 
*
lowering.
*
PETER (CONT’D)
74
*
Jesus just let them arrest him 
*
tonight and... 
*
JOHN
75
*
(overriding Peter off)
*
You tried to stop them!  Maybe 
*
that’s not the way Jesus wants it 
*
to be.
*
PETER
76
*
(cutting John off)
*
What does he want? This whole night 
*
make no sense to me.  It’s all 
*
going wrong!  How will Jesus become 
*
king  - he’s being arrested by the 
*
officials of the very people that 
*
he’s meant to lead!  
*
CLOSE ON FIRE

PETER - ALONE - he looks at the gate - thinking of escaping.
*
CHRIS
*
Notes his reaction.
*
BACK ON PETER
*
He turns and see John heading into the house.  Suddenly, the 
*
doors close and John is left outside.  He looks around... 
*
feels the cold... blows on his hands for warmth...
*
PETER
80
*
(blowing on hands)
*
He then spots the fire and heads towards it. THE CAMERA RISES *
ABOVE THE COURTYARD FOR A VIEW OUTSIDE.
*
CUT TO:

EXT. CAIAPHAS' HOME/OUTER WALL - CONTINUOUS
*
Gizmo pulls Joy away from the crowd and to a section of wall 
*
away from the gate.
*
JOY
81
*
Gizmo, what are you doing?
*
GIZMO
82
*
Chris might be in trouble in there. 
*
He stops and ponders.
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
83
*
Maybe I can locate him with my scan-
*
cam.
*
His SCAN-CAM rises up on a TELESCOPING SHAFT.
JOY
84
Forget about him, Gizmo.  
*
She heads toward the wall to sit down.
*
JOY (CONT’D)
85
*
If he doesn’t want to be with me 
*
then I don’t want to be with him.
*
Gizo sadly retracts his scan-cam and cross to sit beside Joy.

CLOSE ON PETER - eyes darting.  He keeps his head down.  Just *
then, Servant Girl #1 walks by, then backs up to stare

intently at him.
SERVANT GIRL #1 [MATTHEW

sees them taking Jesus away -- and flees in the other 
direction, (down the side of the wall where the tree is)

EXT. SEA OF GALILEE - BEACH - DAY [POSSIBLE RE-USE #109]
CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO MATERIALIZE in the Superbook FX.  They 
look around.
CHRIS
106
*
So, where are we now, Giz?
*
Gizmo’s head rises as his goggles flip into place. HE LOOKS 
AROUND AND TO LEFT OUT TO SEA BUT DOES NOT LOOK DOWN THE 
COASTLINE TO THEIR RIGHT. 
POV THROUGH GOGGLES - Sea Of Galilee.
GIZMO
107
We have arrived at The Sea of 
Galilee. It also appears Superbook

flipping goggles off)
... approximately three weeks 
forward in time.

Man, we gotta get home soon or I’ll 
miss my chance to play basketball 
with the coolest guys in school. 
JOY

They’re not cool.  
(then up - turning)
Giz, a pair of binoculars please. 
Giz opens his chest and binoculars extend on the arm as...
CHRIS
110
What did you say?
She takes the binoculars.
JOY

(innocent) 
*
“Giz, a pair of binoculars please?”

Joy turns away and looks down the beach through the 
binoculars.  Chris steps up behind her.

 CHRIS
112
No.  Before that.  You said 
“They’re not cool.”  Just shows 
what you know, Joy.  
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - The disciples’ BOAT is moored down 
the coast.  There is a small skiff tethered to it. (Reuse 
from 109 and 201)
CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT’D)
113
*
Ask anybody at school. It’s taken 
me all year to prove I got what it 
takes to hang with them, and now 
they’re gonna let me. 
BACK ON TWO SHOT - Chris is over Joy’s shoulder - boasting - 
chest puffed - thumbing at himself, as she lowers her 
binoculars and turns....
CHRIS (CONT’D)
114
So, that makes me...
JOY
115
(matter-of-fact)
Totally Uncool too.
She hands Gizmo back the binoculars and turns to walk away.
CHRIS
116
What?!  Wait!  
*
Gizmo steps up beside Chris with a worried expression.  Chris 
starts to raise his voice as Joy gets farther away.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
117
I told you, Joy.  If I said I hung 
out with the new president of the 
Chess Club, do you know how much 
they’d make fun of me?  
ON JOY - she’s storming away. 
PUSH IN FAST ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
CHRIS (CONT’D)
118
FINE!  
He whirls back to Gizmo and brushes his hand over Gizmo’s 
faceplate turning his face to a TOUCHSCREEN MODE. 
CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT’D)
119
If Joy doesn’t want to hang with me 
I don’t want to hang with her!

 WIDER ANGLE - Chris steps back as Gizmo’s face returns and 
his chest plate opens as a basketball protrudes on the arm.  
Simultaneously, his head piece is flipping open and the 
extension rod is rising up.  At the top (where we usually 
have his Scan-Cam) a basketball backboard is unfolding and 
the rim and net flip down into place. Chris takes the 
basketball from the arm and steps back.  The chest arm 
retracts and the chest plate closes as Gizmo extends both his 
own two arms forward - pushing them together - and angling 
them downward at a 45 degree angle. 
GIZMO
120
Chris, Joy has been your friend a 
lot longer than those boys at 
school.
FAVOR Chris spins in his corkscrew move and shoots.  The 
balls swishes through the net - comes down - bounces off 
Gizmo’s extended/angled arms and ricochets right back to 
Chris, who catches it.
CHRIS
121
Well, I can be her friend when I’m 
with her, and I can be their friend 
when I’m with them.  They never 
have to know about each other. 
*
(effort shooting)
*
He shoots and makes another basket.
CLOSE ON GIZMO - The ball comes down and ricochet’s O.C. To 
Chris again.  His expression shows concern.  He rotates his 
*
head to look down the beach where Joy was headed.
*
CUT TO:
*
EXT. SEA OF GALILEE-DISCIPLES AREA - DAY
Joy approaches the moored boat.  The disciples have a fire 
*
pit situated in a few nearby trees. There are fishing nets 
strung out to dry.  Peter is coiling a rope.   
*
JOY
122
Hi, I’m Joy and I...
*
(Peter looks up)
*
Wait...  You’re Peter. You were 
*
with Jesus... at the house of

Caiaphas.
*
Peter doesn’t say anything.  He rises and heads up to some 
*
hanging nets.
*
JOHN
123
We’re all followers of Jesus.

Or... we were.
Joy turns as John approaches.

THOMAS (O.S.)

After he died, we were all so

fearful. 
THOMAS MOVES PAST JOHN, WHO RISES AND PICKS UP THE 
*
CONVERSATION.   
*
JOHN (O.S.)
128
Most of the Disciples hid from the 
*
Romans or the mob.  Others 
*
simply... ran away.
Thomas has heard this part of the conversation as he is drags *
a net past.  He stops. 
*
THOMAS (O.C.)
129
*
But then the most amazing miracle 
*
happened.  Jesus rose from the 
*
dead!
*
JOY
130
*
(stunned)
*
What?  I remember... I mean... If 
*
he’s alive where is He?

THOMAS
131

He has come to us several times but

He has been... different. I saw Him 
*
and... was not certain it was Him.

THOMAS
136

Why did I ever doubt him?

Peter is dragging a net towards the shore.  He looks lost -

extremely troubled.

PETER
137
*
I’m... going fishing.
*
JOHN 
138
*
We’ll come too.
*
The other disciples start to walk past on their way to the 
boats. Joy looks up at John.  
*
JOHN (CONT’D)
139
He cannot forgive himself.

JOY
140

He denied even knowing Jesus.

JOY
142
(sigh) And some people don’t even 
feel bad for what they did. 
DISSOLVE TO:
*
EXT. SHORELINE NEAR BOATS - LATER 
Chris and the disciples are up on the large boat.  John is 
pulling up the anchor next to him.  Joy and Gizmo are down in *
a smaller boat.  
*
JOY (CONT’D)
143
*
I’ll take the small boat.
*
(beat, sadly - to Gizmo)
I don’t think Chris wants to be 
around me anyway.
Gizmo climbs in with Joy. 
*
Chris watches Joy and Gizmo get into the boat but his pride 
*
won’t let him apologize. He turns and sees Peter pulling up 
the sail. He moves to him.
CHRIS
144
Peter, that night they arrested 
Jesus... I understand why you had 
to say you didn’t know him.
Peter stops pulling on the sail line and looks at Chris.
*
CHRIS (CONT’D)
145
I mean, they could have arrested 
you.  Who knows what everyone was 
*
thinking that night?  You had to 
*
protect yourself. Didn’t you?
*
PETER
146
Jesus knew Satan was about to test   
me... and I failed.  
He busily ties off the sail as Chris watches.  Then he turns 
to Chris again.
PETER (CONT’D)
147
(forming thoughts that 
will become 1 Peter 5:8)
Never let down your guard, Chris.  
The devil is like a roaring lion 
sneaking around to find someone to 
attack.
Peter EXITS.  PUSH IN ON CHRIS as he absorbs this.

 EXT. SEA OF GALILEE - ON WATER - NIGHT (MONTAGE)
A BRIEF MONTAGE shows the Disciples setting out in their boat 
to fish.
Hands pull the sail.
*
THE BOW OF THE LARGE BOAT - cuts through the water.
*
A NET - flung through the air, falls and envelops CAMERA.
WIDE - they fish with the nets.
*
THE DISCIPLES peer into the water looking for signs of fish.  
The net lines run out behind the boat.  Thomas looks over to 
Peter. Peter averts his gaze.
*
THE MENS’ HANDS - drag a net into the boat.  It is empty.
*
QUICK CUTS - as the nets go out.  And come back in, empty.  
*
And out again.  And in - empty.  And then...
X-DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SEA OF GALILEE - ON WATER - LATER - NIGHT 
ON CHRIS - seated, peering over the edge.  Joy and Gizmo 
*
float over in the skiff.  Gizmo has his wrist device opened.  
There is a cable running from it down into the water.  Chris 
looks over the edge.  They all whisper:
GIZMO
148
Chris, I have been checking this 
area with sonar and...
*
He reels in the TRANSDUCER line. <WHIZZZ!>
GIZMO (CONT’D)
149
... perhaps the disciples should 
*
move to another location.  There 
are no fish in the vicinity.
Chris glances forward at the dispirited fishermen and the 
bundled-empty nets.
CHRIS
150
I think they kind’a figured that 
out already, Giz.  Keep lookin.’
He takes a beat to look down at Joy.  
JOY shoots a quick glance up at Chris and then looks away.  
Chris looks away - tension between them.

The sea is flat. The boat is 100 yards off shore (Biblical)

ANGLE PAST LARGE BOAT - A MAN stands on the shore in the 
distance.  [ART NOTE: This is Jesus, and to underscore the 
notion that they do not initially recognize Him, we will 
shoot him in a manner that keeps his face hidden: distant 
shots, oblique angles, viewed from behind, etc.]

Chris glances toward Joy who is ignoring him.
CHRIS

Mmmm....
(then looking towards 
Jesus and the others)
Looks like Jesus isn't angry with 
Peter.  Which is great, y’know, 
especially after what happened.
Joy keeps looking ahead as she replies evenly:
JOY
181
Of course, it helps that Peter was 
really sorry for what he did.
ON CHRIS - fishing for a ‘get out of jail’ card.  He eyes Joy 
- takes a beat - then says...

Right. - Boy, sure would be nice if 
we could be more like that.  
Forgiving and everything... right?

Lord, I...

Jesus knows what is in Peter’s heart.  This time, instead of 
three acts of denial, Jesus elicits from Peter three 
promises:

Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me

ON TRIO - they all smile.  Rift mended.  Then a VOICE CALLS:
PLAYER #2 (O.S.)
200
Hey, Quantum!  You gonna play with 
us or not?
Chris and Joy turn to see:
ACROSS THE COURT - Student #1 and #2 stand in the door 
leading out.
CHRIS - shakes his head.
CHRIS

You know what... I’m not gonna.  
Nope.  I gotta go.

THE STUDENTS - standing in the doorway trade puzzled looks.
STUDENT #1

RESUME ON TRIO - as Chris smiles at Joy.
CHRIS
203
Coolest thing just happened. Joy, 
was just made President of the 
Chess Club.  So I’m gonna go 
celebrate -- with my friends.
Chris and Joy head off through the door leading to the hall.  
Gizmo shoots a ‘catch you later’ pointed finger gesture at 
the O.S. Players.
GIZMO

Besides, who needs the Quantum 
*
Corkscrew when I’ve got the Gizmo

Gut Shot!

He pops his chest place open... rears back a little so his 
*
open chest is aimed upwards towards the far basket.  He makes *
the shot <SWISH>
*
Then he tries it again but basketballs start rapid-firing out *
of his chest but the powerful kickback causes the shooting 
*
goes wild.  Ball are missing the backboard and bouncing off 
*
the walls.

*
firing continues.
