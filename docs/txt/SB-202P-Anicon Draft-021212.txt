CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: “Trust God - He has a plan for 
you, even if you don't see that plan!”
LOG LINE: Chris has a very precise plan for how he is 
going to get what he wants; and he can't handle it when 
things don't go according to his own plan.  Superbook 
transports him back to the time of Joseph, and as he 
watches as Joseph rise to be governor of Egypt, he learns 
to forego his own plans and trust in God's plans instead.

REVISED ANICON DRAFT 2-12-12
EXT. JACOB’S TENT - EST. SHOT - DAY 
INT. JACOB’S HOUSE OR TENT - CONTINUOUS 
JACOB and YOUNG JOSEPH stands near the entrance.  YOUNG 
BENJAMIN is at their feet.  Joseph is proudly wearing a 
beautiful new CLOAK. 
JOSEPH
1
Father, I love this new coat!
He hugs Jacob.
JACOB
2
And I love you, Joseph, more than 
mere words could ever express. 
JOSEPH
3
I must go show my brothers my new 
gift!
On Benjamin, whose mouth is full of figs, as he looks up 
at Joseph adoringly. 
JOSEPH
4
And you, Benjamin, must not eat 
all those figs! Save some for when 
I get back!
Joseph runs off.  Jacob picks up Benjamin.  They walk out 
and wave as Joseph dashes off.  
EXT. FIELD IN CANAAN - DAY
MUSIC SWELLS - There is a single olive tree on a hilltop. 
Young Joseph runs up the hill. 
EXT. FIELD BELOW THE OLIVE TREE HILL - CONTINUOUS
 There are SHEEP grazing.  There is a WELL near a 
shepherd’s LEAN-TO of sticks and straw.  Ten of Joseph’s 
brothers, stand in a group... sit on the well... lean 
against the lean-to uprights. They are Reuben, Simeon, 
Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar and 
Zebulun. (Perhaps Reuben is leaning against the well 
whittling with a knife (reuse from 102) on a stick.
PUSH IN ON REUBEN - he stops whittling as he sees 
something O.C.  He moves from the well and looks up the 
hill. His eyes grow cold, filled with anger – he throws 
the whittling stick down forcefully and grips his knife 
with intensity.
POV - Joseph is running up near the olive tree heading in 
their direction, waving happily.
JOSEPH
5
Brothers! Brothers, look what 
Father’s given me!
JUDAH
6
Father’s given him another gift!
The brothers gather around Judah <MUSIC BECOMES DARKER-
OMINOUS>
BACK ON YOUNG JOSEPH - WIDE - he waves happily and runs 
towards them and camera.  As he gets closer his 
expression changes from joy to concern as he arrives at 
camera and passes out of frame. 
CLOSE ON YOUNG JOSEPH, looking frightened. 
JOSEPH
7
Levi... Judah... What are you 
doing?!
CLOSE ON JUDAH AND BROTHERS - They look menacing
BACK ON JOSEPH
JOSEPH
8
You’re scaring me. Stop it!
OVERHEAD SHOT of Young Joseph walking into the midst of 
his brothers; they form a circle around him.  He looks 
around, bewildered.
MUSIC PEAKS - He turns to run, but rough hands grab him.  
His cloak is torn from his shoulder as a mass of hands 
and arms engulf him, hiding him from view. The gang lifts  
Joseph above their heads and move toward the well. 
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  2.
 BROTHERS
9
(angry rabble walla throughout)
JOSEPH
10
NO! Judah! Zebulun! Stop!
REUBEN
11
Do not harm him! 
JOSEPH
12
Dan, stop! 
REUBEN 
13
Simeon, put him down!
POV INSIDE OF WELL - The group of brothers reaches the 
well and they dump Joseph in -- keeping his cloak.
JOSEPH
14
(SCREAM) NOOO!!!
PUSH IN ON THE CLOAK in their hands.
FADE OUT:
END OF TEASER
                        ACT ONE
INT. QUANTUM FOYER - DAY
CLOSE ON A FUTURISTIC STOPWATCH in Gizmo’s hand - ticking 
off seconds - as we hear....
GIZMO (O.C.)
15
Go Chris Quantum!  Go!
WIDEN TO REVEAL Gizmo is standing at the top of the 
stairs. He has the stopwatch in one hand and a clipboard 
in the other.  Chris is charging upwards carrying a pile 
of laundry. Gizmo watches Chris fly by as he says...
GIZMO
16
Putting away your clean laundry, 
forty five seconds!  
(zipping after Chris)
Check!
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  3.
 Gizmo zips off after Chris on the way to Chris’ bedroom.
ANGLE BELOW ON FRONT DOOR
It opens and Joy sticks her head in.
JOY
17
Chris?!
She hears <SOUNDS OF DRESSER DRAWERS AND CLOSET DOORS> 
upstairs.  She enters and heads for the stairs.
JOY
18
Gizmo?
INT. CHRIS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Laundry is now piled on the bed.  Chris is racing INTO 
AND RIGHT OUT OF SHOT... reading from an open book in one 
hand... while tossing items of laundry to his open 
dresser drawers. 
GIZMO (O.C.)
19
Assigned reading, thirty eight 
seconds.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS
He slams the book shut... tosses it in the dresser and 
whirls around, <KICKING> it shut as he exclaims...
CHRIS
20
YEAH! Right on schedule!
Chris then grabs a bottle of mouthwash off his dresser 
and tips his head back to take a swig as...
JOY (O.S.)
21
Hi guys?  What’s going on?
ANGLE TO INCLUDE JOY coming in the door.  Chris runs up 
to Joy, head back, as he gargles mouthwash.
CHRIS
22
(GARGLING SOUNDS through the 
following action)... 
He reaches for Gizmo’s wrist and raises the hand that 
holds the stopwatch.  He points to it and explains 
through his gargles.... Joy gives him a withering look.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  4.
 JOY
23
I don’t speak gargle.  What is 
going on?
GIZMO
24
Gargling, ten seconds! 
Chris drops Gizmo’s wrist and races OUT OF FRAME.  Gizmo 
writes on his clipboard as he says...
GIZMO
25
Chris has the perfect plan to 
complete every one of his daily 
chores, tasks and duties before we 
leave for the soccer match.  
Chris zips INTO FRAME AND RIGHT OUT balancing a stack of 
books on his head... a pile of snack food boxes and his 
Holo-9 Sleeve in his left hand... and an upended baseball 
bat supporting a spinning frisbee like a plate-spinner at 
the circus.
<O.C. CRASHES> Joy winces.  Gizmo beams and makes a big 
Check mark on his clipboard with a flourish.
GIZMO
26
Clean the room. Five seconds flat!
ANGLE ON CLOSET
Chris <SLAMS> the door shut and turns brushing off his 
hands with finality.
WIPE TO:
EXT. ROAD - DAY
The Quantum Van drives along.  No other cars. 
CHRIS (O.C.)
27
Out the door 3 minutes ahead of 
schedule.  
INT. PROFESSOR QUANTUM’S VAN - DRIVING - DAY
Chris, Gizmo and Joy sit in the back seat with seat belts 
on.  Professor Quantum, (unseen) drives in front. Chris 
has his hands behind his head, acting cool. He whips his 
arms down and grabs a clip board, flipping through pages 
of paper as though looking for something.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  5.
 CHRIS
28
If we don’t execute my plan 
perfectly... 
Chris flips a page on the clipboard as he continues..
*
CHRIS
29
*
... if my dad doesn’t follow my 
exact route... 
(flips page)
... if all the traffic lights 
don’t change in the exact 
sequence... 
(flips page)
...we won’t get there in time...
(flips page)
...and we won’t score the best 
seats. 
(flips pages closed 
and tapping the 
clipboard)
It’s all right here.  The perfect 
plan.  Thanks to me.
Joy rolls her eyes.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (O.C.)
30
uh-oh... 
Chris looks up - CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal professor id 
driving in the front seat.  He is leaning forward to look 
out the windshield and the car is still moving.
MOVING POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD - We see a STRANDED 
MOTORIST at a car with its hood up on the side of the 
road. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (O.C.
31
Stranded car up ahead.  I’m going 
to help.
The car pulls up behind the stranded car.
CHRIS (O.C.)
32
But dad...
INT. QUANTUM VAN - CONTINUOUS
The car pulls over and stops as Chris leans forward 
toward the front seat with his clipboard.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
33
... this isn’t in my plan!
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  6.
 PROFESSOR QUANTUM
34
We should help those in need, 
Chris, before we go to soccer 
matches.
Chris slums back and scowls angrily.   We HEAR Professor 
Quantum exit the car. 
CHRIS
35
Ugh! Man, all the planning I do! I 
can’t believe this is happening!  
SUPERBOOK rises with the <SUPERBOOK SFX>.
CHRIS AND JOY
36
Superbook!
Gizmo grabs the clipboard and begins writing furiously.  
GIZMO
37
Oh no!  Modifying plan!  Modifying 
plan!  
BLUE FLASH...
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
38
Whoaaa....
EXT. WIDE ON MOTORIST CAR AND QUANTUM CAR BEHIND IT - 
CONTINUOUS
The Professor and the Motorist are looking in the open 
hood of the motorist’s car.  The Quantum car fills with a 
flash of blue light. Professor Quantum looks around the 
corner of the hood as though he heard something and then 
shrugs - looking back at the motorist’s engine.
INT. SUPERBOOK TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
SUPERBOOK
39
I am taking you to meet a man who 
trusted in God’s plan in spite of 
many difficulties.
WIPE TO:
INT. PHARAOH’S JAIL CELL - DAY 
The kids are dropped into the shadowy cell. As Gizmo 
falls:
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  7.
 CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
40
WHOOOA!
GIZMO
41
Airbag deploy! Uh-ooooo
An airbag inflates from Gizmo’s chest.  Chris and Joy 
dump to the floor; CLOSE ON GIZMO - as he bounces on his 
airbag, down then <BOING> up and out of frame!
CLOSER ON THE KIDS -  as Gizmo falls into frame.  HIS 
CHRONOMETER IS NOW OPEN AND HE IS TRYING TO READ IT AS HE 
BOUNCES:
GIZMO
42
We have landed in ancient Egypt.  
The land of the - whoa!
<BOING> Gizmo hits the floor and bounces up again.
JOY
43
This’ll get annoying.
Joy reaches out and pulls the air plug. Gizmo shoots 
around the room as the bag <DEFLATES> until he finally 
<PLUNKS> to the floor.
GIZMO
44
AAAH! (impact grunt). Thank you.  
That would have gotten annoying.
ON JOY, CHRIS AND GIZMO
The stand in the shadowed cell and look around.  A beat - 
CHRIS
45
Okay, prison.  This trip certainly 
can’t get any worse.
TOTH
46
*
(O.C. - Grunting)
*
An UGLY GOON, TOTH, leans menacingly into frame from the 
shadows.  He glares down at them.  They don’t move but 
their eyes slowly turn in his direction - in unison.
JOY
47
And then... it did.
Camera pulls out to reveal Gizmo with his back to Chris, 
Joy and Toth.  He sniffs the air with distaste.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  8.
 42A GIZMO
48
(Sniff) Eeeyyuu... what is that 
odor? It smells like rotten figs 
on a hot car seat.
Gizmo turns and the camera moves with him to capture his 
expression as he slowly looks upwards at the O.C. 
Prisoner. 
CAMERA ADJUSTS to a TWO SHOT.
42B  TOTH
49
Hi.
GIZMO
50
(deadpan)
Hi.
(beat Toth smiles a 
slow -bad-toothed 
grin)
Okay... we’re done here. (SCREAM 
INTO IMPACT-DIZZY FALL)
Gizmo bolts forward but slams into the door trying to get 
out and falls over with a thud.
ANGLE FAVORS - TOTH turns and begins to approach Chris 
and Joy with slow menace.  Suddenly...
JOSEPH (O.S.)
51
Toth, you are not bothering my new 
assistants, are you?
Toth’s demeanor suddenly changes. He takes a small, 
deferential step back and lowers his head.
TOTH
52
No, Joseph.  I am not.  
WIDE ON JOSEPH, a man in his thirties, tall, strong.  He 
opens the door to the cell. He is dressed like the 
prisoners and stands with PHARAOH’S GUARD #1
JOSEPH
53
I did not think so.  
He turns to PHARAOH’S GUARD #1.
JOSEPH
54
Guard, will you please release 
these three into my care?  They 
will assist me.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  9.
 CLOSE ON CHRIS JOY who turn to each other, smile, and 
then quickly rush forward, lifting Gizmo to his feet and 
zip him O.C. As they throw backwards glances at Toth. 
47A GIZMO
55
Psst! Guys, I found out where that 
foul fig smell is coming from.  
ANGLE ON TOTH - He lifts an arm and sniffs.
47B TOTH
56
Figs? (Sniff then smiling) 
(dreamily) figs!
INT. PHARAOH’S JAIL - WORK AREA - DAY 
A WORK TABLE IS PROMINENT. Joseph takes folded linen 
piles and loads them into Gizmo’s arms. Joy fills a 
basket with small loaves of bread.  Chris pours water 
from one clay jar into another.  
JOY
57
Joseph, this is amazing, you’re a 
prisoner but you run the prison?  
CHRIS
58
*
So, how did you wind up here 
*
anyway?
*
PUSH IN ON JOSEPH AT THE TABLE
JOSEPH
59
That is an interesting story.
CONTINUE THE PUSH IN TO THE TABLE ITSELF - EVERYTHING 
ELSE IN SHOT - INCLUDING THE BG BEGINS TO DISSOLVE - THE 
TABLE REMAINS AND WE USE IT TO MATCH MORPH/DISSOLVE TO:
INT. JACOB’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK - DAY 
THE MORPH DISSOLVE TO Jacob’s table and benches. YOUNG 
JOSEPH stands on the table, he addresses his BROTHERS, 
the most prominent among them is JUDAH.  Small BENJAMIN 
sits to one side, listening intently. 
JOSEPH (V.O.)
60
When I was young I would have the 
most vivid dreams.  One was a 
dream that my brothers were all 
stars in the sky, and they were 
bowing down to me! 
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  10.
 Go CLOSE ON BENJAMIN to keep him relevant in the story.
*
JOSEPH (V.O.)
61
*
 -- In my youthful enthusiasm I 
shared these dreams with them... 
and I angered them.
ON THE BROTHERS
*
BROTHERS
62
[grumbling sounds]
The Brothers gesture derisively, and turn to walk away 
from Young Joseph.
EXT. FIELD IN CANAAN - FLASHBACK CONTINUES - DAY
Young Joseph walks up a hill. He WEARS HIS SPECIAL CLOAK. 
(SAME BASIC SCENE AS PROLOGUE BUT NOT REUSE BECAUSE THE 
TIMING IS DIFFERENT HERE TO ACCOMMODATE THE V.O.)
JOSEPH (V.O.)
63
I did not realize at the time how 
jealous my brothers were of those 
dreams... and of the favor my 
father showed me.  
CLOSER ON YOUNG JOSEPH
He stops and looks down the other side of the hill. The 
Ten Brothers stand in a circle.
JOSEPH
64
One day, they had finally had 
enough.
BACK ON YOUNG JOSEPH as he waves happily and runs towards 
them. THERE IS A WIPE...
Joseph is lead away - hand tied - sold into slavery. 
JOSEPH (V.O.)
65
My own brothers beat me and sold 
me as a slave. I heard them 
planning how they would explain to  
my father that I had been killed 
by a wild animal.
 The cloak is sprinkled with blood from a bowl.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  11.
 INT. JACOB’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK/MONTAGE - EVENING
The boys present a bloodied cloak to Jacob.  He is 
stunned and pulls it to his chest wailing with tears 
streaming down his face.
JACOB
66
(scream of anguish)
Nooooo!  My son!
60A - JOSEPH (O.C.)
67
That must have made my father very 
sad. 
CROSS DISSOLVE:
INT. PHARAOH’S JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY
CLOSE ON JOSEPH he is in the exact same pose as Jacob 
was.  He holds towels to his chest and he too has tears 
in his eyes.
He wipes away a tear and straightens up. He starts down 
the hall away from Toth’s cell - further into the prison - 
(The entrance door is behind them as they move - 
important for staging to come)
JOSEPH
68
(clearing throat) Then, while a 
slave, I was arrested for 
something I did not do.  And here 
I am.
JOY
69
That all just sounds so unfair! 
JOSEPH
70
All I want is a chance to face my 
brothers and find out what kind of 
men they are today. - I hope they 
have changed.
CHRIS
71
Joseph!  I got it!  What you need 
is an A-number-one Plan!  A plan 
to get you out of here.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS
72
I mean, how are your brothers ever 
going to look up to you and honor 
you,  if you’re stuck in here?  
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  12.
 JOSEPH
73
God has a plan for each of us, 
Chris.  That I know. And for 
whatever reason my path has 
brought me here, I know it is only 
to serve God.  
CLOSE ON THE KIDS - They digest this for a beat - we PUSH 
IN ON CHRIS.  Then...
STEWARD (O.C.)
74
(barking)
JOSEPH!
WIDER ANGLE 
They all turn and look back down the corridor. The 
PHARAOH’S STEWARD is marching forward.  
GIZMO
75
Uh-oh...
CAMERA TRACK BACKWARD HOLDING STEWARD AND THE GUARDS -- 
THE CAMERA SLOWS The three march straight INTO CAMERA.
The Steward and the two Court Guards march towards 
Joseph, Chris, Joy and Gizmo.
Joseph watches them come to a stop.  The kids look up at 
Joseph to see what he’s thinking.  Joseph simply waits 
and says quietly:
JOSEPH
76
It has been awhile, my friend.  I 
feared you had forgotten me.
Steward bows his head.
STEWARD
77
I apologize, Joseph. Come - there 
may be a way to get you out of 
prison.
They turn together and start back down the corridor in 
the direction of Toth’s cell and the entrance door. 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo follow with interest.
STEWARD 
78
I am here at the Pharaoh’s request 
because you told me the meaning of 
my dreams, two long years ago, 
when I was imprisoned here with 
you.  
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  13.
 They walk together. Chris, Joy and Gizmo watch from a 
distance
STEWARD
79
And everything you said about my 
dreams came to pass, exactly as 
you predicted.  
CLOSER ON - Joseph and the Steward.
STEWARD
80
I was given back all my duties, 
just as you said.  
They stop walking and the Steward turns to Joseph 
speaking with deep importance.
STEWARD
81
But now, the Pharaoh himself is 
haunted with the most terrible and 
confusing dreams, Joseph.  No one 
in all the land has been able to 
explain their true meaning or 
bring him peace.
CLOSE ON JOSEPH
JOSEPH
82
The Spirit of the one true God can 
provide what the Pharaoh seeks. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - They look at one another 
in amazement.
ON STEWARD AND JOSEPH - 
STEWARD
83
*
Yes, but if you do not please the 
Pharaoh with your 
interpretation...
CLOSE ON THE KIDS - they look fearful waiting for the 
*
explanation. Suddenly they hear...
*
TOTH (O.C.)
84
*
(throat clearing 
*
sound)
*
They turn to look at...
*
TOTH - behind the bars.  He runs a finger slowly across 
*
his neck - indicating he will be killed.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  14.
 TOTH
85
*
(kkkkkkk)
BACK ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
*
Chris and Joy GULP. Gizmo’s head darts down into his 
chest in fear.
GIZMO
86
(fearful yelp)
CLOSE ON STEWARD AND JOSEPH - PUSH IN ON JOSEPH as he 
gets Steward’s meaning.
FADE OUT:
END ACT ONE
                       ACT TWO
FADE IN:
INT. PHARAOH’S COURT - DAY
Joseph (shaved and cleaned-up) kneels in front of the 
Pharaoh’s throne. A crowd stands behind him, solemnly 
watching. Chris, Joy, and Gizmo are watching, too.
GIZMO
87
Wow, Joseph cleaned up really 
nice.
GUARD (O.C.)
88
*
SILENCE!
*
Everyone turns to see...
*
ANOTHER ANGLE 
*
Pharaoh approaches Joseph.
*
PHARAOH (GENESIS 41:15)
89
*
I have heard it said of you that 
you can understand a dream, to 
interpret it. 
DRAMATIC PAUSE - 
CUT TO the kids - 
CUT TO the Steward - 
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  15.
 CUT TO the Officials.  Each gives an expression that 
matches their emotion...
BACK ON PHARAOH AND JOSEPH - after the appropriately 
dramatic beat.
JOSEPH
90
It is not in me...
ANGLE ON PHARAOH, surprised.
ANGLE ON STEWARD, CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO reacting. 
GIZMO
91
Oh no! (neck cutting sound)
Gizmo makes the same “neck slicing” motion Toth made 
earlier. --- Joy shoves his hand down - perturbed. 
Steward looks surprised and worried. 
BACK ON JOSEPH  
JOSEPH
92
God will give Pharaoh an answer of 
peace.
Pharaoh stares at Joseph, trying to figure him out. 
Finally, he proceeds.
PHARAOH
93
Behold, in my dream I stood on the 
bank of the river.
PUSH IN ON JOSEPH - He bows his head and begins to <GLOW> 
with the HOLY SPIRIT EFFECT.
WHIP ZOOM INTO JOSEPH’S EYES 
Dream sequence (Record all accurate scripture and we will 
dissolve blend and overlap across the words as the images 
in the dream dissolve and flow together.
PHARAOH
94
(wild 01:09:43:11)
Suddenly seven cows came up out of 
the river, fine looking and fat; 
and they fed in the meadow.  
PHARAOH
95
*
Then behold, seven other cows came 
up after them, poor and very ugly 
and gaunt, such ugliness as I have 
never seen in all the land of 
Egypt. 
*
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  16.
 PHARAOH
96
*
And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up 
the first seven, the fat cows.
PHARAOH
97
*
Also I saw in my dream, and 
*
suddenly seven heads came up on 
one stalk, full and good. 
98
PHARAOH
99
*
Then behold, seven heads, 
withered, thin, and blighted by 
the east wind, sprang up after 
them. And the thin heads devoured 
the seven good heads.
We are suddenly BACK IN THE PHARAOH’S COURT - but as the *
dream continues to be discussed, the DREAM IMAGES appear *
on the floor - transparent but moving.
*
JOSEPH
100
(wild - 01:09:43:11)
The dreams of Pharaoh are one: The 
seven good cows are seven years, 
and the seven good heads are seven 
years; 
JOSEPH
101
*
And the seven thin and ugly cows 
which came up after them are seven 
years, and the seven empty heads 
blighted by the east wind are 
seven years of famine. 
JOSEPH
102
*
God has shown Pharaoh what He is 
*
about to do. 
JOSEPH
103
*
Indeed seven years of great plenty 
will come throughout all the land 
of Egypt;  
JOSEPH
104
*
... but after them seven years of 
*
famine will arise, and all the 
plenty will be forgotten. Egypt 
will starve.
ANGLE ON PHARAOH, looking perturbed.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  17.
 JOSEPH
105
I am sorry, Pharaoh, but unless 
you plan ahead and save crops from 
the years of plenty, Egypt will 
not survive.
ON STEWARD, CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO.
STEWARD
106
Pharaoh will not like that 
meaning.
Chris and Joy look at each other fearfully.
CLOSE ON PHARAOH as he rises.  He steps down from his 
dais and circles Joseph, considering him.  
PHARAOH (GENESIS 41:38) (CONT’D)              
107
Can we find anyone else like this 
man so obviously filled with the 
spirit of God? 
He doesn’t give them the chance to respond - however they 
act in agreement - happy and NOT in defiance.  Pharaoh 
moves close to Joseph.
PHARAOH
108
As your God told these things to 
you, Joseph, I can think of no one 
wiser to appoint as manager. 
ON JOSEPH - as he slowly raises his eyes to meet 
Pharaoh’s.  Pharaoh still challenges with his words, 
watching Joseph’s reaction as he does...
PHARAOH (O.S.)
109
You will oversee the harvests, and 
set aside crops for the years of 
famine.
ON STEWARD, CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - they react in  relief. 
PHARAOH (O.S.)
110
You will be my governor, second in 
Egypt only to me.  All must obey 
you!  
We hear the <SOUND OF THE COURT CHEERING>
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - They stare in awe. 
JOY
111
I can’t believe this. 
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  18.
 GIZMO
112
Yes, from prisoner to governor in 
one second flat.  
CHRIS
113
Guys, Joseph helped us back there 
in prison. I say we make a plan to 
help him. If he succeeds as 
Governor, he can get back to 
Canaan where his brothers will 
look up to him and honor him, just 
like in his dream. 
MUSIC SWELLS - 
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. PHARAOH’S PALACE - DAY
The doors swing open.  The Pharaoh strides out with 
Joseph. Joseph now wears the jewelry and garments 
described in -(Genesis 41:42) 
There is a triumphant exit from the palace to a pair of 
waiting Chariots with drivers. 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo follow and watch in wonder.  THE 
MUSIC CRESCENDOS AS THE CHARIOTS DRIVE AWAY.  In the BG 
*
we see Chris, Joy and Gizmo swept up in the time travel 
*
Superbook effect AND WE...

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. EGYPTIAN FIELD - DAY - YEARS LATER
Establish the blighted land.  
CAMERA ANGLES TOWARDS a FAR DISTANT GRAIN WAREHOUSE with 
a long line a people with donkeys on leads and empty 
baskets in their hands - some trapped to their backs etc. 
are standing, waiting to get in. (Keep this shot 
extremely wide and high so we do not need to make out the 
individual characters only the long line of waiting 
people - Egyptians and Foreigners.)
INT. GRAIN WAREHOUSE - DAY 
The warehouse is filled with baskets, sacks and clay 
vessels full of grain. A line of 5-8 TRAVELERS leads up 
to the table; they are buying grain.  
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  19.
 (They are part of the long line we saw outside but we 
only need these 5-8 to personify all the others out of 
sight.)
ON THE TABLE.  Joy and Gizmo stand at the table helping 
to provide the grain to those in need. Chris lays over 
the edge of the table bemoaning his fate.
CHRIS
114
How long have we been here, Giz?
CLOSE ON GIZMO
*
GIZMO
115
It has been quite a while since 
*
Superbook brought us forward in 
time.  And of all the plans you’ve 
*
made to help Joseph get back to 
*
Canaan, to face his brothers, none 
*
of them have worked.  
*
ANOTHER ANGLE
*
Chris drums his fingers on the table with attitude. 
*
INCLUDE JOY
*
JOY
116
How about helping us, Chris? There 
are a lot of hungry people trying 
to buy grain.
GIZMO
117
*
Statistically, it appears your 
plan to get Joseph back with his 
brothers will not work unless they 
just happen to show up in Egypt on 
their own. 
Chris thumbs over his shoulder, out the open door.
CHRIS
118
Yeah. And the day that happens 
I’ll shave my head and dress like 
an Egyptian.
Suddenly Judah and some of Joseph’s brothers appear at 
the door. 
JUDAH (O.S.)
119
Excuse me. I am Judah. My brothers 
and I have traveled here from 
Canaan.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  20.
 Joy slowly turns to Chris with a sarcastic smirk.
JOY
120
I’ll see if I can borrow Joseph’s 
razor.
Chris quickly looks around and spots Joseph deeper in the 
grain storage area of the storehouse, speaking with one 
of the workers. He takes off on the run, leaving Joy and 
Gizmo alone with Joseph’s brothers. 
JOY
121
(nervous laugh)
ANGLE ON JOSEPH
Chris races INTO SHOT and yanks Joseph behind a pile of 
baskets.
CHRIS
122
Joseph!
JOSEPH
123
(chuckling)
Chris, what is the meaning of 
this?
CHRIS
124
Any chance you know those guys at 
the door?
Joseph looks and his expression changes from a smile to a 
serious stare.  Joseph look over the edge of a grain 
*
basket.  He sees his brothers.
*
QUICK FLASHES - RE-USE footage of the scenes when the 
*
bothers attacked and sold Joseph into slavery.
*
JOSEPH
125
Those are my brothers. 
CHRIS
126
Do you think they’ll recognize you 
after all these years?
*
Joseph slumps down behind the grain basket.
*
JOSEPH
127
They must believe I am dead by 
now. But God has brought them here 
for a reason.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  21.
 CHRIS
128
Okay!  Then here’s what we do:
109
Just go reveal yourself and use 
your power to take over your 
family’s farm.  
Chris leaps up, excited that he’s “solved” Joseph’s 
*
dilemma. 
*
CHRIS
129
*
From then on they have to do 
everything you say. Happy ending. 
Dream fulfilled.  
He does a quick karate kick and low arm “pump” move.
CHRIS
130
Who-ahh! Am I good or what? 
CLOSE ON JOSEPH - His look hardens a little.
JOSEPH
131
The thing I must know is have they 
changed.  
Joseph steps out.  He raises a pointed finger in 
accusation and calls out... 
JOSEPH
132
I am Governor here!
GENESIS 42 - The brothers all drop to the ground and bow 
with their faces to the earth.
Chris smugly saunters back over to Joy and Gizmo, 
WHISTLING
JOY
133
What’s he doing?
CHRIS
134
Oh, just following my plan.
ANGLE ON JOSEPH
JOSEPH
135
Where do you come from?
JUDAH
136
From the land of Canaan, to buy 
food.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  22.
 JOSEPH (GENESIS 42:09 CEV)
137
You are spies!  You have come to 
find our where our country is 
weak. 
CHRIS
138
What?!
JUDAH
139
Sir, we come from a family of 
twelve brothers. The youngest, 
Benjamin, is still with our father 
in Canaan, and one of our brothers 
is dead.
Joseph strides forward.
JOSEPH
140
I am going to find out who you 
really are. 
CLOSE ON JUDAH - still bowing - Joseph leans down above 
him and lowers his tone.
JOSEPH
141
By the life of Pharaoh, you shall 
not leave this place unless your 
youngest brother comes here.
Joseph rises - CAMERA REMAINS LOW for a DRAMATIC UP 
ANGLE. He turns and walks away.
JOSEPH
142
Guards, take them away!
ON JOY and GIZMO - Chris steps into FRAME beside them and 
they stare as the Guards move the brothers out. 
CLOSE ON JOSEPH

As the brothers are taken away we PUSH IN on Joseph and

we see a TEAR roll down his cheek.

But father, The Governor has given 
his word.  And Simeon awaits our 
return! We must bring Benjamin as 
proof that we have not lied! 
INT. JACOB’S HOUSE - DAY
CLOSE ON JACOB: 
JACOB
144
No! You are never to go back!
JUDAH
145
Father, you must listen! The 
governor threw us in prison 
because he believed we were spies.
REUBEN
146
But we were able to make a deal 
with him. Only we had to leave 
Simeon behind. 
JUDAH
147
The governor has promised if we 
bring Benjamin to him as proof we 
are not lying he will let Simeon 
go.
JACOB
148
My son Joseph is dead; and now my 
Simeon is a prisoner in Egypt. And 
you want to take Benjamin?!

But Father, it’s the only way-

 JACOB
151
No! I will not allow it! 
BROTHERS
152
[walla “Father!” “Listen to 
Judah!” etc.]
Jacob rushes from the room, followed by Judah and the 
brothers, Chris and Gizmo (Benjamin stays seated).
ON JOY as she looks across the room at Benjamin.  He is 
seated at the table, despondently picking at a bowl of 
figs. Joy walks over and sits next to him.
JOY
153
Do you remember much about your 
brother Joseph?
BENJAMIN
154
I was little.  I remember I used 
to follow him everywhere he went. 
I even said I wanted to grow up to 
be just like him.
JOY
155
I think he would like that. 
Benjamin looks at her oddly.
JOY
156
I mean, would have, if... you 
know.
BENJAMIN
157
I know. It’s been so many years, 
yet still my father weeps over 
Joseph’s death.
Joy puts her hand on Benjamin’s shoulder.
THE CAMERA MOVES over to focus on one of the grain bags.  
In TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE the bag slowly goes from full to 
empty.
INT. JACOB’S HOUSE - DAY
Jacob and his sons stand inside of the tent with solemn 
expressions on their faces. Jacob turns and walks 
outside. He looks out over his pasture, including the 
hill where he last saw Joseph.
His sons come out of the tent and watch him. 
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  25.
 Jacob looks up the hill and sees a ghost-like image of 
Joseph as a young boy. The image fades.
JACOB
158
If I let you go, you may all die.
JUDAH
159
If we don’t go, we will die.
PAN across the resolute brothers. Jacob watches as 
Benjamin approaches from behind and joins them. Their 
decision is made. Jacob shows his grim acceptance on his 
face. 
EXT. WALL OF JOSEPH’S PALACE - DAY
*
In the distance, a caravan can be seen heading towards 
the palace, kicking up dust.
ON JOSEPH AND STEWARD looking over the wall.
JOSEPH
160
Benjamin is with them. When they 
arrive, bring Chris, Joy and Gizmo

JOY

[slight snoring]
PULL OUT TO REVEAL Joy asleep in a hammock - the hammock 
coming out of Gizmo’s chest, and held to the wall.  Gizmo 
gently rocks the hammock.
Chris paces nearby.
JOSEPH
162
Chris! Joy! Are you here?
Suddenly, Joseph sweeps into the room. Joy jumps out of 
the hammock, as it zips back into Gizmo’s chest cavity.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  26.
 JOSEPH
163
Ah! There you are. I’m sorry to 
have kept you waiting here all 
day.
CHRIS
164
What’s been going on? Did you 
punish your brothers?
ON JOSEPH - 
*
JOSEPH
165
No. In fact I fed them, gave them 
grain, and sent them on their way. 
You spent time with them. Now, 
tell me, what kind of men have 
they become? 
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO.

GIZMO

good care of us.

away! What about making them bow 
to you and--
ON JOSEPH - Steward rushes into the room, interrupting 
*
Chris.
STEWARD
169
Sir! Your brothers have been 
caught stealing! Our guards are 
bringing them back here now.
ON CHRIS AND JOY looking shocked.
CHRIS
170
What? Stealing? 
JOY
171
Not them!
ON JOSEPH - He smiles.
SB #202P Joseph the Dreamer - Anicon Draft 2-12-12 --  27.
 JOSEPH
172
Come. Let us go and see what kind 
of men they really are.
He exits.  Chris and Joy share a look and shrug at 
Joseph’s odd reaction to the theft.
INT. JOSEPH’S PALACE/HOUSE - DAY
THE CAMERA TRAVELS AROUND THE GOVERNOR’S PALACE/HOUSE 
taking in Chris, Joy, Gizmo and Steward standing off to 
the side. 
The CAMERA CONTINUES moving to Joseph. THE CAMERA THEN 
REVEALS the brothers are all on their knees, bowing in 
front of Joseph, each with a bag of grain in front of 
them. THE CAMERA TRAVELS ALONG THE ROW OF BROTHERS, 
ending at the bag in front of Benjamin, open, and a 
silver cup lies there.  
ON JOSEPH
JOSEPH
173
So, Benjamin is the thief. 
He looks down at Benjamin
BENJAMIN begins to look up but then lowers his gaze in 
fear.
JOSEPH
174
Why would you steal my special 
cup?
JUDAH
175
Benjamin would not have done that!
The brothers stand to protest.

Joseph, listen-
ON JOSEPH AND JUDAH, as Joseph holds up a hand, 
indicating “stop.”
Judah steps forward.
JUDAH
180
If you must punish someone, take 
me as your slave. Let this boy 
return home.
JOSEPH
181
You would take his place?
JUDAH
182
I would. Our father has suffered 
enough with the loss of his other 
son. I do not want him to go 
through that again.
Joseph steps forward - Judah winces.
CLOSE ON JOSEPH as his face softens; a tear forms in his 
eye. He leans in and WHISPERS into Judah’s ear.
JOSEPH
183
The cup was not stolen. It was a 
test. I needed to know if my 
brothers had really changed.
JUDAH
184
Your brothers?
Joseph grabs Judah by the shoulders and makes him look 
into his eyes.
JOSEPH
185
Look closely. I am Joseph, your 
brother that you lost so long ago. 
I have changed - and now I know 
you have as well.

Forget my plans, Joy. I think I’m

more in God’s plans.
Chris pulls at his car door.
