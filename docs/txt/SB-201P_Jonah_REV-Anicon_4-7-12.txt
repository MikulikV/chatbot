Written by Cory Edwards
REV. Anicon Draft 4-7-12
CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: “Be obedient to God – even when 
you don’t want to obey. God has a plan that includes 
mercy, love and forgiveness for all people.”
LOG LINE: Joy witnesses the theft of a bike by a school 
bully. To Joy’s surprise, the principal offers mercy to 
the thief instead of justice. Joy, Chris and Gizmo join 
Jonah on his journey, from inside the whale to saving the 
sinful Ninevites. Joy relates to Jonah’s frustrations, 
but is also convicted to live out God’s forgiveness, even 
with someone she doesn’t like.

 JONAH

She’s the one who threw my backpack 
into the pool last month! 
CLOSE ON PRINCIPAL TRAVIS: She thinks a moment.
*
PRINCIPAL TRAVIS
37
(sigh) She’s been in and out of my 
office all year. 
She rises and crosses, putting an arm around Joy. 
PRINCIPAL TRAVIS (CONT’D)
38
Maybe this time... we can help her 
*
make another choice.
JOY
39
I..I don’t understand.
*
PRINCIPAL TRAVIS
40
What if you and I go talk to her 
*
and give her a chance to come 
*
clean.
JOY
41
Come clean? Wha...she’s a crook!
*
PRINCIPAL TRAVIS
42
Punishment might just push her 
further down that path. Meet me 
after study school and let’s try it 
my way first.
Principal Travis exits.  CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JOY fuming.

*
CHRIS
43
*
Hey, Joy. What’s up?
*
JOY
44
I can’t believe it. This school is 
soft on crime!  Sharon Myers stole 
a bike in broad daylight and Miss 
*
Travis just wants to let her slide 
by -- er, give her mercy or 
*
something. Hmgh! A girl like Sharon 
has to be taught a lesson.

he can show it to others.
EXT. SHIP DECK - STORMY DAY
WIDE SHOT: The kids and Gizmo are dropped onto a swaying

Where are we now, Gizmo?

 CHRIS
50
(panicked)
We don’t need an info-scan to tell 
us we’re on a ship, Joy!  
The boat pitches sharply and they cling to the rail.
CHRIS, JOY & GIZMO
51
Whoahhh...
CHRIS
52
And it takes me a while to get my 
“sea legs!”
CLOSE ON GIZMO - He spins and stops wearing a pirate costume, 
with eye patch, a hook hand, and “sea legs” - bright BLUE 
with white CUFFS, and ANCHORS painted on the sides.  He taps 
the legs... 
GIZMO
53
Argghh... I’ve got me own Sea Legs, 
mateys! 
(back to his own voice)
See? Waterproof, made for 
floatation and they have these neat 
little anchors on them.  Oh, and 
*
the best part...
Chest plate opens and a metallic-robot PARROT vibrates on the 
extender arm <BOINNNGGG> then it flies up onto Gizmo’s 
shoulder.
PARROT

59
You actually heard God’s voice?
ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE Chris, Joy and Gizmo speaking with 
Jonah.  He stands, with his back to the kids, leaning on a 
large clay vessel. 
JONAH
60
Yes. Telling me to go to Nineveh, a 
city filled with God’s worst 
enemies.  Killers of His people. 
CLOSE ON JONAH
JONAH (CONT’D)
61
God wanted me to warn them He was 
about to pass judgement.  
Jonah whirls and ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE THE KIDS
JONAH (CONT’D)
62
But why warn them?! So they repent - 
say they are sorry - and then 
receive God’s mercy?  I say no! - 
If Nineveh is doomed then let it be 
doomed! 
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS
63
So you ran away from God?  
Gizmo leans INTO SHOT
GIZMO
64
Technically speaking, hiding from 
the all-knowing deity is 
*
statistically impossible.
ON JONAH - he looks up and around as the room pitches in the 
storm. <THUNDER ROLLS>.  
Superbook #201P "Tough Love"- REV-Anicon Draft 4-7-12  8.

like this? 
The Captain’s foot KICKS Jonah from the hammock. 
CAPTAIN (O.C.)

Get up and pray to your God!  
Jonah falls from the hammock onto the pitching floor.  
JONAH

QUICK MONTAGE
Three crewmen’s HANDS reach in the pouch - selecting lots
ON CHRIS, JOY & GIZMO 
*
CHRIS
75

They must be trying to see if Jonah 
*
caused the storm.

The pouch is tossed and lands at Jonah’s feet. The CAMERA 
*
pans up his body to show his anxious face.
*
The ship tosses in the storm LIGHTNING and <THUNDER>
CAMERA STARTS CLOSE ON A CREWMAN’S CLOSED FIST. IT OPENS, 
*
REVEALING STONE LOT, CAMERA MOVES LEFT, FINDING ANOTHER 
CREWMAN’S CLOSED FIST. IT OPENS. CAMERA PANS LEFT AND THE 
SAME ACTION HAPPENS ONCE MORE.

What country are you from?  Who are 
your people?
*
Jonah rises and shouts in a clear voice.
*
JONAH
80
I am a Hebrew, and I worship the 
Lord, the God of Heaven, who made 
*
the sea and the land.
CREWMAN #1
81
You see?!  It is his fault!
CREWMAN #3
82
He told us before that he was 
trying to flee from his God!
CREWMAN #1 (O.S.)
83

Why did you do it?!
The boat pitches wildly.  The men tumble.

CREWMEN (O.C.)

CAPTAIN

What should we do to you to stop 
this storm?!
ON JONAH - The boat lurches and Jonah clings to the post. He

man’s sin. 
PUSH IN ON JONAH as Crewman #1 continues to speak O.C.

Jonah, Chris and Joy clinging to the floating mast and sail.  
The SHIP is seen departing in the distance.  GIZMO buzzes up 
to them effortlessly, like a speed boat. <BZZZZZ>

JONAH
104
I am so sorry, my friends. 
*
CHRIS
105
*
Don’t worry about it. Er... See, 
*
even the storm’s cleared now.  
All’s well that ends well, I always 
*
say. 
CLOSE UP on Gizmo. A device inside him starts <BEEPING>.
GIZMO
106
Ah... Chris... I am detecting a 
very large creature just three 
fathoms below us.
There is a large shadow passing beneath them.  
*
CHRIS/JOY/JONAH
107
*
(fearful questioning “huh”?)
*
Then a massive fish surfaces briefly 20 Yards ahead.  It 
*
submerges again.
*
ANGLE ON THE KIDS - THEY HAVE NERVOUS EXPRESSIONS. Gizmo’s 
chest plate opens and the parrot comes out on the arm. It 
looks around and squawks with a flapping-frightened 
expression.
PARROT
108
(SQUAWK)
The frightened Parrott flies straight upward like a shot. 
CAMERA TRACKS with him until CAMERA is about 50 feet above 
the water. CAMERA slows, and Parrott gains OFF-CAMERA.

ANOTHER ANGLE - The MASSIVE FISH breaks the surface with a

<THUNDERING SPLASH>! Its face is bigger than a city bus 
*
coming towards them.

JOY

ACT TWO
*
FADE IN:
*
INT. INSIDE THE FISH
DARKNESS and <DRIPPING SOUNDS>, as if from inside a cave. 
REVEAL A WIDE SHOT as Gizmo’s FACEPLATE glows to life. It 
illuminates a fleshy cavern.
CHRIS
112
Ewww... and I thought fish were 
*
slimey on the outside.
*
JONAH 
113
*
This is unbelievable.  Disaster 
follows me at every turn!  I will 
not live through this.
CLOSE UP -- Joy and Chris share a look - Joy turns to Jonah.
JOY
114
Jonah... I think if God wanted you 
dead... you’d be dead.  I almost 
think He wants to save you.
CHRIS
115
*
Next time He should just send some 
life preservers.
JOY
116
You ran in the opposite direction 
from where God wanted you to go - 
and it seems like He’s done one 
thing after another to pull you 
back to Him.
CLOSE UP on Jonah. He looks around A LONG TIME, thinking.
Superbook #201P "Tough Love"- REV-Anicon Draft 4-7-12  15.
 JONAH
117
(amazed)
He pursues me, even now. 
WIDER SHOT: Jonah looks up as the camera moves around him. He *
drops to his knees and begins slowly...
JONAH (CONT’D)
118
I cried out to you in my great 
trouble, Lord, and He answered me. 
TWO-SHOT: Chris and Joy watch Jonah with encouragement.
JONAH (CONT’D)
119
I called to you from the land of 
the dead, and Lord, you heard me!

lurches. 
GIZMO
120
Feels like we’re moving in a new 
direction.
CLOSE UP on Joy -- savoring the meaning of this.
JOY
121
It sure does.
WIDE SHOT, MOVING OUT. Both kids bow their heads with Jonah.
JONAH
122
You threw me into the ocean depths, 
and I sank to the heart of the sea.
*
Jonah’s voice fade and cross fades as the prayer continues 
*
MONTAGE OF TIME PASSING AS...
*
JONAH (CONT’D)
123
The mighty waters engulfed me; I 
*
was buried beneath your wild and 
stormy waves. But you, O Lord my 
*
God, snatched me from the jaws of 
death! As my life was slipping 
away, I remembered the Lord. And my 
earnest prayer went out to you in 
your holy Temple. Those who worship 
false gods turn their backs on all 
God’s mercies. But I will offer 
sacrifices to you with songs of 
praise, and I will fulfill all my 
vows. For my salvation comes from 
the Lord alone.
