Episode #
"Saul and David"
TAKE-AWAY: We should not take revenge. We should repay evil 
with good
CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO ARE HEADING HOME ONE NIGHT WHEN TWO TOUGH 
TEENS GRAB CHRIS' GUITAR AND HOP ABOARD A MONORAIL TRAIN. CHRIS 
GIVES CHASE AND DEMANDS THAT THEY RETURN HIS INSTRUMENT, BUT 
INSTEAD, THE TOUGHS SMASH IT. LIVID, CHRIS VOWS TO TAKE REVENGE, 
ONLY BEFORE HE CAN DO SO, SUPERBOOK TRANSPORTS OUR TRIO BACK IN 
TIME TO MEET THE ADULT DAVID. (THEY MET WHEN THE YOUNGER VERSION 
DEFEATED THE GIANT GOLIATH). DAVID HAS BECOME A GREAT WARRIOR, BUT 
HE ALSO FACES AN UNPREDICTABLE FOE IN KING SAUL.  SAUL, WHO KNOWS 
THAT DAVID WILL SOMEDAY REPLACE HIM AS RULER, ALTERNATES BETWEEN 
AFFECTION AND JEALOUS RAGE, AND TRIES TO KILL DAVID SEVERAL TIMES. 
CHRIS EXPECTS DAVID TO SEEK PAYBACK; INSTEAD, DAVID SPARES SAUL'S 
LIFE IN THE CAVES AT EN GEDI.  SEEING PROOF OF DAVID'S LENIENCY (A 
TORN FRAGMENT OF HIS GARB IN DAVID'S HAND), SAUL BEGS FOR MERCY 
FOR HIM AND HIS DESCENDANTS, WHICH DAVID GRANTS.  CHRIS, JOY AND 
GIZMO RETURN HOME. WITH DAVID'S EXAMPLE IN MIND, CHRIS DECIDES 
AGAINST VENGEANCE, KNOWING THAT WHATEVER JUDGMENT AWAITS THE 
DELINQUENTS RESTS NOT WITH HIM, BUT WITH GOD.

TAKE-AWAY: We should not take revenge. We should repay evil 
with good
FADE IN:
EXT. GILGAL - DAY
A field is lined with TENTS.  We HEAR <BLEATING> of sheep and 
the <LOWING> of oxen. Israelite soldiers.. Some on horse 
back... come and go. CAMERA PASSES THE CIRCLE OF TWELVE 
STONES and FINDS THE ROYAL TENT as A SERVANT hurries over and 
excitedly calls inside...
SERVANT
1
Your highness!  King Saul!
The tent flap <SNAPS> open and KING SAUL steps out as the 
servant approaches out of breath.
SERVANT (CONT’D)
2
The prophet Samuel -- he is here!
King Saul allows a grin and moves past the SERVANT.
ON SAMUEL 
(Reuse model from episode 106) Saul rushes up to greet him.
SAUL [1 SAMUEL 15:13 NLT]
3
May the Lord bless you. I have 
carried out the Lord’s command!
SAMUEL glares and gestures off with his staff.  
SAMUEL [1 SAMUEL 15:14 NKJV]
4
What then is this bleating of the 
sheep in my ears, and the lowing of 
the oxen which I hear?
Copyright (c) 2012 The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. 
 SAUL - is taken aback by his critical tone.
SAUL [1 SAMUEL 15:15 NLT]
5
It’s -- true that the army spared 
the best of the sheep and cattle.
(rationalizing)
But they are going to sacrifice 
them to the Lord your God.  We have 
destroyed everything else.
CLOSE ON SAMUEL - his eyes narrow as he scolds:
SAMUEL [1 SAMUEL 15:17-19 NLT]
6
The Lord has anointed you king of 
Israel. And the Lord sent you on a 
mission and told you, ‘Go and 
completely destroy the sinners, the 
Amalekites, until they are all 
dead.’  
Samuel leans in to Saul, who leans back slightly at the tone.
SAMUEL
7
Why haven’t you obeyed the Lord?
SAUL [1 SAMUEL 15:20 NLT]
8
But I did obey the Lord. 
CLOSE ON SAUL
SAUL
9
I carried out the mission he gave 
me. I brought back King Agag, but I 
destroyed everyone else.
ON SAMUEL
SAMUEL
10
*
LISTEN! Obedience is better than 
*
sacrifice, and submission is better 
*
than offering the fat of rams.
*
Saul drops to his knees. 
*
SAUL [1 SAMUEL 15:24-25 NLT 
11
PARAPHRASE]
Yes, it’s true, I have disobeyed 
your instructions and the Lord’s 
command. I was afraid of the people 
*
and did what they demanded.  But 
now, please, forgive my sin and 
come back with me so that I may 
worship the Lord!

 SAUL’S POV - LOW ANGLE UP AT SAMUEL
*
SAMUEL [1 SAMUEL 15:26 NLT]
12
I will not go back with you.  Since 
*
you have rejected the Lord’s 
command, He has rejected you as 
king of Israel.
CAMERA RISES UP AND ANGLE ARCS AROUND AS
*
Samuel turns his back on Saul and takes a step to leave.  
SAUL’S HAND reaches out and grabs the hem of Samuel’s garment  *
-- which tears with a <RIP>.  
CLOSE ON SAUL
SAUL
13
(gasp)
He glances down at the fragment in his hand.  His expression 
*
goes from shock to anguish to agony. 
*
Then his hand slowly squeezes it as his hand begins to shake. *
SAMUEL - slowly turns.  He looks down at Saul.  
*
SAMUEL [1 SAMUEL 15:28 NLT]
14
Thus the Lord has torn the kingdom 
of Israel from you today -- and has 
given it to someone else.  One who 
is better than you! 
Samuel turns his back on Saul and moves away.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. VALLEYVIEW MONORAIL TRANSIT STATION #1 - NIGHT
CHRIS, JOY and GIZMO stand on the platform. Chris has his 
guitar slung over his back with no case.  A cool wind rustles 
some leaves along the otherwise empty platform.  The kids dig 
hands into pockets and cock their shoulders up against the 
wind.
CHRIS
15
Sorry guys.  My band rehearsal ran 
later than I thought.

BOOP!>
GIZMO

And I can always keep myself busy!
TOUGH #1/#2 (O.C.)
18
(Laughter and goofing)
Gizmo face plate changes back to his own face with a worried 
expression.
GIZMO
19
Uh-oh...
ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO 15 year old TOUGHS approach.
TOUGH #1
20
Hey.  Classic guitar, man!
TOUGH #2
21
Mind if I take a look?
Tough #1 whips the guitar off Chris’ back.
CHRIS
22
Hey! 
Just then, a MONORAIL TRAIN starts to pulls in. Tough #1 
flips the guitar to Tough #2 and shoves Chris backwards. 
TOUGH #1/#2
(ad-lib laughter and 
harassing) I’m with band 
hahaha!
JOY
Chris!
JOY AND GIZMO - catch Chris to keep him from falling.
GIZMO
23
Hey!  You give Chris back his 
guitar...
He stretches his neck forward the ten feet and his head winds 
up in between the Toughs as they face the stopping monorail 
car.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
24
... or else I will be forced to...
SB - Saul & David - Rec Draft - 11/06/12 -            4.

 The toughs reach up and grab Gizmo’s head as the monorail car 
doors <SHUSHH> open.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
25
GAAAACK!
BACK ON JOY CHRIS AND GIZMO’S BODY WITH HIS NECK EXTENDED OFF 
CAMERA.
CHRIS
GIZMO!!!
TOUGH #1/#2 (O.C.)
(laughter)
<THWAP>  Gizmo’s neck retracts into frame.  O.C. the Toughs 
have taken his head and twisted it so Gizmo has a huge knot 
in his neck. The knot hits and his head won’t retract into 
his body, so it bounces like a bobble head doll.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
26
(dizzy choked sounds)
JOY
27
They’re getting away!
Chris and Joy run off as Gizmo shoots his head up and un-
knots it in one effort.
*
GIZMO
28
I’m right behind you!
He head drops properly intoplace and he zips off in the wrong 
direction - and CRASHES into the wall of the platform.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
29
(impact hit)
Joy and Chris races INTO FRAME, grabs Gizmo and Zip O.C. With 
him.
INT. MONORAIL CAR
Chris, Joy and Gizmo leap inside as the doors slide shut, 
<HISS-FOMP!>  The train pulls out of the station and quickly 
accelerates <BUILDING ELECTRIC WHIR>.
EXT. MONORAIL TRAIL - MOVING - NIGHT
CAMERA IS OUTSIDE TRAIN MOVING ALONG - TRACKING Chris as he 
runs through the compartments, toward the front of the 
speeding train.  <WHOOSH-WHOOSH SFX>
INT. MONORAIL TRAIN - SECOND COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
The rear doors <HISS> open.  Chris bursts in, followed by Joy 
and Gizmo, points and shouts:
SB - Saul & David - Rec Draft - 11/06/12 -            5.
Copyright (c) 2012 The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. 
 CHRIS
30
<panting> Give me my guitar!
REVERSE - The Toughs turn and taunt:
TOUGH #2
31
Oh.  You want it back?  Here!
Tough #2 flings it down the aisle past CAMERA.
THE GUITAR - spirals INTO SHOT, ricochets off a WINDOW, 
<CRACKING> IT, then <CLANGS> into a handrail; the neck 
<SNAPS> off the body and the pieces fall to the floor.
JOY AND GIZMO - recoil and grimace at the impact.
THE TOUGHS - back away, and then scoot off through the door 
into the forward compartment.
TOUGH #1
32
Go-go-go! <laughter>
FAVOR CHRIS 
He kneels and picks up the broken guitar neck.  
CHRIS
33
(Seething)
They are going to pay for this.
WIDEN TO INCLUDE Joy and Gizmo.
GIZMO
34
Shall I compute the cost of the 
repairs, Chris?
Chris stands, weighing the jagged cudgel in his hand.
CHRIS
35
That’s not the kind of payment I’m 
talking about!
Chris starts through the empty car. He calls back over his 
shoulder with vengeance in his eyes.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
36
Gizmo, tap into the train’s 
electrical system and kill the 
lights in the next compartment.
He brandishes the broken, jagged guitar neck and <SMACKS> it 
hard on a vertical pole as he reaches for the compartment 
door.

They’ll never know what hit ‘em.
Suddenly, he’s stopped short by the SUPERBOOK SFX.  He whirls 
as Superbook arrives between him and Joy and Gizmo 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
38
Superbook, I got a score to settle.  
I am NOT going anywhere.
He opens the train door to leave but the SUPERBOOK FX pulls 
him back O.C.
ANGLE ON JOY AND GIZMO
Chris is whisked up beside them and then all three are pulled 
into the vortex.

GIZMO (O.C.)

kind of army encampment.  
JOY (O.C.)
44
Giz, where exactly are we this 
time? 
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Chris spots a shield next to the entrance and picks it up to 
inspect it as Giz lifts his arm to extend his scanner. 
Superbook Shimmers to life behind them and they all turn.
CHRIS
45
Superbook!  Good!  Get me back in 
that train so I can clobber those 
creeps!
Superbook suddenly projects a HOLOGRAPH. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
46
Whoa... check it out.
The kids gather around the 3D image as see a CLIP of YOUNG 
DAVID [RE-USE from “A Giant Adventure”] as he winds up and 
uses his sling to slay Goliath. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
47
That’s David!  Remember him?

 Gizmo turns to the open tent flap and starts a facial scan of 
the people outside. <BEEPING SFX>
GIZMO
50
Guu-uuys... you are not going to 
believe this but... I think I just 
found David HERE!
FAVOR JOY AND CHRIS
Joy and Chris turn and move beside Gizmo at the open tent 
flap.  
JOY

It’ll be so cool to see him again!
They look out at a group of Soldiers.  (Superbook  Holograph 
will dissipate behind them.)  
JOY (CONT’D)
52
Umm... I just see a bunch of 
soldiers, Giz.
ANGLE ON GIZMO - His face plate shows the group of soldiers 
outside. (DAVID, SOLDIER #1, SOLDIER#2, SOLDIER #3)   (Adult) 
David is pointing and giving them directions.  Gizmo’s screen 
does a grid affect and the grid zooms in BLINKING over the 
David’s face.  Then his face flickers back and forth between 
YOUNG DAVID’S FACE and his current ADULT DAVID’S FACE. 
GIZMO
53
Yes.  However, their leader is 
David. -- All grown up.
Chris and Joy lean in to look at his screen.

ANGLE WIDENS as they step out of the tent. Gizmo’s facial 
scanner shuts off as he follows.
CHRIS
57
What?!  David clobbered that giant, 
Goliath, when he was younger.
A SERGEANT overhears them and stops to remark:
SERGEANT
58
<chuckle> Everybody tells that 
story about David.  
(stopping hands on hips)
But you don’t have time for 
stories.  Get back to work. 
The kids look miffed.  Gizmo puffs up self-important.
GIZMO
59
Yes.  Of course!  Work!  Umm... 
Perhaps you could you be a bit more 
specific?
The Sergeant <KNOCKS> on the shield Chris is holding.
SERGEANT
60
Finish cleaning and packing David’s 
armor?
GIZMO
61
Right!
CHRIS
62
Cleaning! (breathing)
He breaths on the armor and polishes the spot with his 
forearm sleeve.  Joy thrusts a forefinger in the air.
JOY
63
And packing!
They turn to zip back into the tent.
GIZMO
64
That is what we do.
They exit inside.  HOLD ON THE SERGEANT as he hears <BANGING

71
And you, in particular, have served 
me well, David.
CLOSE ON DAVID
David bows reverently.
CLOSE ON SAUL
His look darkens as CAMERA PUSHES IN and there is a SUDDEN 
FLASH MEMORY. (REPLAY IN SEPIA) the opening scene where 
Samuel tells Saul...

Thus the Lord has torn the kingdom 
of Israel from you today -- and has 
given it to someone else.  One who

AT THE WINDOW
Saul steps over and glares down at the O.S. mob.
SAUL [1 SAMUEL 18:8 NLT)

They credit David with ten thousand

Are you kidding after coming home 
to that heroes welcome, the King’s

Then a PLATTER <SHATTERS> as it drops down from above.
GIZMO

Or a nice set of dishes.
They look up and see:

 Suddenly, they hears someone approaching. MICHAL, the younger 
daughter of Saul, runs by the alcove.
DAVID (CONT’D)
102
(stage-whisper)
Michal!  Over here!
She backs up and slips into the alcove, gazing lovingly at 
David but restraining herself from embracing him.  
MICHAL
103
David!  Are you hurt?
She wants to reach out and touch him but refrains.
DAVID
104
Your father threw a spear at me but  
missed the mark.
JOY
105
This is crazy!  Why would King Saul 
do something like that?
CLOSE ON MICHAL AND DAVID
Frame this with Michal looking up at David is a heroic two

story.
MICHAL [1 SAMUEL 16:14 NLT PARAPHRASE]

Long ago, the Spirit of the Lord 
left my father and a tormenting

She smiles as David adds:

INT. PALACE - SECOND FLOOR THRONE ROOM - YEARS EARLIER - DAY 
(FLASHBACK)
Saul slumps in the throne, brow furrowed, glowering.  The 
Servant cautiously steps up and pleads:
SERVANT [1 SAMUEL 16:16 NKJV EDITED]
108
Master, command your servants to 
seek out a man who is a skillful 
player on the harp.
Saul dismisses him with a wave.  The Servant persists.

110
All right.  Find me someone... and 
bring him here.

The Servant shows YOUNG DAVID [the model from “A Giant 
Adventure”] into the room.  He cradles his Kinnor.
SAUL - stands at the window, shoulders slumped.  He pivots 
and glares at the new arrival.
ANGLE AT DOOR - The Servant nudges Young David forward.  
Young David begins to PLAY THE SAME MELODY heard earlier.
ON SAUL - as the MUSIC washes over him.  His expression 
softens.  His brow relaxes.  He even allows himself a smile.
MICHAL (V.O.) [1 SAMUEL 16:23 NLT

And whenever the tormenting spirit 
*
troubled him, David would play the

harp. (alt. kinnor)

Then Saul would feel better, and 
the tormenting spirit would go 
away.
Suddenly, a stern O.S. VOICE interrupts:
SERVANT (O.S.)
113
David!
They all turn to see:
THE SERVANT with GUARD #1 AND GUARD #2  Chris and Joy look 
around.  No way out. David tenses.  Michal eyes him, worried.
DAVID
114
State your purpose.

 ON SERVANT 
He is conflicted.  He knows Saul wants David dead.
SERVANT
115
I come to deliver the king’s 
orders.
(beat)
You are to lead a thousand men into 
battle.
David thinks.. Looks at Michal... 
She looks back at him, worried.  
DAVID
116
I will do as my King commands.
Michal looks down in sadness.  David turns to the Servant and 
Chris steps up to interrupt.
CHRIS
117
But David, Saul just threw a spear 
at you!  Why would you turn around 
do what he wants?
David looks down at Chris and replies, matter-of-fact:
DAVID
118
Because he is my king.
He smiles warmly to Michal and exits the alcove as the 
Servant and the Guards escort him off.  
Chris shakes his head.  Michal puts a hand on his arm.
MICHAL
119
Look after him.
And she leaves as well, heading in the opposite direction.  
GIZMO
120
What are we going to do, Chris?
CHRIS
121
I don’t know, Giz.  But if a guy 
tried to skewer me, I’d be looking 
for a way to get back at him.  I 
sure wouldn’t be following his 
orders.  I can tell you that!

Yes, I survived the battle Saul 
sent me to fight.  
The kids whirl.

Why didn’t you come with me?  I was

He walks past them and looks down at the encampment, lost in

In a scene depicting 1 Samuel 18:8, David charges over a 
hill, leading his men into battle (“And there was war again; 
and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and 
struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him.”)  
His slashing sword handily dispatches every Philistine who 
dares to confront him, though the actual hacking is kept O.S.

David.  This is the day of which 
the Lord said to you, ‘Behold, I

Take the men further into the caves

Saul barely feels the tug.  But he whirls and draws his
