REV ANICON DRAFT - 10-08-12
TAKE-AWAY:  Don't give up.  Don't ever give up.  Unconditional 
loyalty to God is eventually rewarded.
SYNOPSIS:  Chris is having the worst week of his life.  When his 
Grandpa suddenly dies he feels as though he can't go on.  He wants 
to blame someone for all his pain and doesn't understand why such 
bad things are happening to him when he tries so hard to be good.  
Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Job, a man who is tested 
beyond limits Chris has ever experienced.  As Chris becomes 
involved with Job's plight he is amazed at his profound ability to 
remain faithful to God through all sorts of adversity.  Chris 
takes strength from Job's example, and when our kids return home, 
Chris applies what he's learned about having faith in God, no 
matter the challenges.  He knows God will not abandon him.

FADE IN:
EXT. HEAVEN - DAY
SATAN <ROARS> up through the clouds - slows to a hover - and 
rotates slowly - getting his bearings -    
SATAN
1
It’s good to be back.  Doesn’t look 
like much has changed. (snicker)
He starts flying towards the main street of heaven. Suddenly 
MICHAEL and FOUR ANGELS <RIP> up through the clouds and form 
an loose barrier.  Satan stops short. 
*
TRACKING SATAN ALONG THE GOLDEN STREET OF HEAVEN - past 
HEAVENLY ANGELS who whirl - surprised at his presence. 
CLOSE ON HEAVENLY ANGEL #1 and HEAVENLY ANGEL #2 - They react 
ANGEL #1
2
*
It is the accuser.
ANNGEL #2
3
*
What’s he doing here?
*
ANGEL #3
4
*
He is presenting himself before 
God.  
*
TRACKING SATAN - He flies towards the throne of God - and 
*
then he RIP-MORPHS into LUCIFER and comes in for a landing, 
dropping his legs downward, and he glides into a walking 
stride - hitting the gold street - he walks directly up to...
THE THRONE OF GOD - God is bathed in a blinding LIGHT - Satan 
approaches, throwing his arms out on both sides with a 
flourish and a bow that is at once supplication and a grand 
presentation of himself.
GOD (NLT-JOB 1:6-12)
5
Where have you come from? - (NKJV) 
 SATAN/LUCIFER (NLT)
6
I have been patrolling the earth, 
watching everything that’s going 
on. 
ANGLE ON THE SIDELINES - Archangel Michael and his four 
Angels arrive and land down with the group that has gathered. 
HEAVENLY ANGEL #3 is in the group and turns to Michael.
HEAVENLY ANGEL #3
7
What does he want?  
CLOSE ON THE LIGHT OF GOD ON THE THRONE - a long beat... will 
He banish the accuser or speak with him?  Finally...
GOD 
8
(CEV)
What do you think of my servant 
Job? No one on earth is like him --
he is a truly good person, who 
respects me and refuses to do evil. 
BACK ON LUCIFER - He speaks this next line as much to God as 
to those watching him.  He’s setting the challenge.  
SATAN/LUCIFER (NLT)
9
Yes, but Job has good reason to 
fear God. 
CLOSE ON LUCIFER - he flicks his hand at the street - a small 
FIREBALL rips open a PORTAL allowing a view of EARTH.  SPEED 
IN TO A SATELLITE PUSH-LIKE-VIEW - FINDING JOB sitting 
beneath a tree near his home.  
SATAN/LUCIFER (NLT) (CONT’D)
10
You have always put a wall of 
protection around him and his home 
and his property.  You have made 
him prosper in everything he does. 
Look how rich he is! 
CLOSE ON LUCIFER - He looks from the portal back up to God.
SATAN/LUCIFER (NLT) (CONT’D)
11
But reach out and take away 
everything he has, and he will 
surely curse you to your face!
With that challenge LUCIFER MORPHS into Satan
CLOSE ON SIDELINE ANGELS - THEY REACT.
HEAVENLY ANGELS
12
(WALLA - Gasps Huh? - What?)
*
CLOSE ON MICHAEL - Waiting in expectation...
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    2
 CLOSE ON SATAN - He cocks his head, looking up at God - has 
he caught Him?  What will He say to this challenge?
CLOSE ON THE LIGHT OF GOD - a long beat... and then...
GOD (NLT)
13
All right, you may test him. Do 
whatever you want with everything 
he possesses, but don’t harm him 
physically. 
CLOSE ON SATAN - a slow grin of satisfaction.  He gives a 
slow bow... And slowly turns his eyes towards...  
POV ON MICHAEL - He is livid.  
BACK ON SATAN he drops through the ground with a <WHOOSH> 
TRACKING SATAN FLYING towards distant Earth. He speeds - 
gaining ahead of camera - trailing flames.
SATAN
14
Job is mine. 
END OF PROLOGUE                        
ACT ONE
FADE IN: 
EXT. QUANTUM HOUSE - DAY                                      
JOY, MR. PEPPER and MRS. PEPPER approach the front door, 
carrying casseroles and a basket of food. The door opens. 
PHOEBE and PROFESSOR QUANTUM embrace the Peppers.  It’s an 
embrace of sorrow with comfort.  
ALL
15
(sad greeting walla - Hi - I’m so 
*
sorry. It’s so sad. Etc...)
*
CLOSE ON PHOEBE AND MRS. PEPPER - They embrace. 
MRS. PEPPER
16
I’m so sorry, Phoebe.
WIDEN TO GROUP - Joy watches intently. Professor Quantum puts 
an arms around Phoebe. She lays he head against his shoulder.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
17
Phoebe’s father was a great man. 
We’ll miss him terribly. 
PHOEBE
18
Please come in.
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    3
 JOY
19
Professor Quantum, how is Chris?
*
Phoebe hugs Joy and smiles down at her.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
20
*
Losing his Grandpa has been very 
hard for him.  They meant the world 
to each other.
PHOEBE
21
*
Chris is out back.  Why don’t you 
go see him, Joy?
Joy hands her mom the basket and heads in through the foyer.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
22
Please, everybody come in.
Mr. And Mrs. Pepper hug Phoebe again and all move off to the 
family room together - a strong visual of good friends - a 
tight extended family - supporting one another.  
As they exit frame we let them gain O.C. And we PUSH IN  on a 
picture on the wall of CHRIS’ GRANDPA smiling with Chris. 
CUT TO:
EXT. QUANTUM BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
GIZMO is rummaging through the shrubs, holding an empty pet 
cage, looking for a missing pet. 
GIZMO
23
Ughh... Here Iggy. Where are you? 
*
Come on boy. (whistle)  Come on. 
*
Joy approaches. 
*
JOY
24
Gizmo? 
Gizmo startles.
*
GIZMO
25
*
(gulp)
*
JOY
26
*
What are you doing?
Gizmo backs out of the bushes and whirls to Joy.
GIZMO
27
Oh, Joy! Thank goodness you are 
back from vacation! It is terrible! 
*
(defeated sigh) Ohhh...
*
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    4
 He collapses on the picnic bench in total defeat.
JOY
28
I heard about Chris’ Grandpa. 
GIZMO
29
(sigh) Joy, this has been the worst 
*
week of Chris’ life!
His face plate flashes to life and Joy leans in to watch as 
the visuals of what Gizmo describes. CLOSE ON CHRIS AND GIZMO 
AT THE BACKYARD PICNIC TABLE - as they stare into the empty 
pet cage, then give one another a startled look and race O.C. 
in opposite directions in search... Gizmo’s hand zips back in 
on its extended arm and whisks the cage O.C.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
30
It all started when he took the 
classroom pet home for vacation... 
and it ran away! 
HIGH ANGLE DOWN ON QUANTUM HOUSE - Its a WINDY and STORMY 
NIGHT.  PUSH IN on Chris bedroom side of the house. 
GIZMO (CONT’D)
31
Then, the storm of the year hit 
Valleyview Wednesday night...
ON CHRIS ASLEEP IN BED - a tree limb CRASHES through the 
glass roof.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
32
... and a tree crashed through 
Chris bedroom roof...
CLOSE ON CHRIS he bolts upright and raises his arm in 
protection but the tree limb hits his arm...
GIZMO (CONT’D)
33
... breaking his arm!
INT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE (RE-USE FROM #102) - Chris sits with his 
mom and dad.  Chris’ arm is in a cast and sling.
ON JOY - watching the vid-screen.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
34
Then, you know all the money Chris 
had been saving from his paper 
route?  It got stolen from him when 
he was on his way to put it in the 
bank...  Everything that could 
possibly go wrong IS going wrong, 
Joy.
JOY
35
And now the worst thing of all, his 
Grandpa died. 
*
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    5
 EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
*
PUSH IN...
*
INT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
*
CHRIS is sitting with his legs pulled up to his chest and his 
arms wrapped tightly around them. He wears a cast but no 
sling.  His sleeve covers the cast except what is visible by 
the wrist and hand.  He looks miserable. Joy slowly crawls in 
and sits across from him.  He doesn’t look at her.  There is 
a long beat... then...
JOY
36
Sorry about your grandpa.
CHRIS
37
(blurting it out)
Why are all these bad things 
happening to me when I try so hard 
to be good?!
*
JOY
38
Chris, sometimes..
CHRIS
39
(cutting her)
*
I’m just gonna stop trying!!
(sudden - low emotion)
My Grandpa died.
*
Joy slowly moves to Chris and puts a hand on his shoulder to 
*
console him.  
*
Gizmo pops up through the hatch door.
*
GIZMO
40
*
Chris, I have searched everywhere 
*
for Iggy and.. 
*
Suddenly, SUPERBOOK rises from the corner and shimmers to 
life.  
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
41
*
Oh, no!  Let me stay behind so I 
can find the class’ iguannnnaaa....
*
Superbook whisks all three away. 
INT. SUPERBOOK TUNNEL 
(New tunnel because of Chris’ arm cast) - The kids float 
along as...

faith in God was put to the test.

WIPE TO:
EXT. PLAIN IN THE LAND OF UZ - CLOUDY AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON OXEN FEET STAMPEDING  <HUMANS SCREAMING>
TRACKING SABEAN #1 - charging on a camel with the oxen 
stampeding alongside.  He swings his short-sword-dagger in a 
circular motion to keep them running.
ANOTHER ANGLE UP AHEAD - SERVANT #1 leaps into frame - back 
to camera - as he waves his arms to stop the camel riding 
Sabean.   The Oxen are veering off CAMERA LEFT.
SERVANT #1
43
Stop!  Those are my master’s oxen! 
(SCREAM)
SABEAN #1
44
*
(efforts)
*
He dives out of the way and the Sabean and Camel charge PAST 
CAMERA almost beheading him with a <SWISH> of his sword.
ANGLE NEARBY - The SUPERBOOK EFFECT deposits the kids.  They 
look O.C. in a panic. <SCREAMS AND STAMPEDING CONTINUE> 
JOY
45
*
(gasp)
*
CHRIS
46
*
Huh?
*
JOY
47
What’s happening?!  Uhhh...AGHHH!!!
*
ANOTHER ANGLE - Sabean #1 careens towards them. Joy drags 
Gizmo and Chris backwards to keep from being run down.
*
CHRIS
48
HEY! WATCH IT! 
*
Sabean pulls to a stop and turns.   
ON CHRIS - Joy and Gizmo move behind him with fearful 
expressions.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
49
I’VE HAD ONE REALLY BAD WEEK, MR! 
AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS WITH 
*
ME!  
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    7
 CLOSE ON THE SABEAN - His eyes narrow.  Then he charges 
straight back towards Chris, brandishing his sword in a wild  
windmilling motion
SABEAN #1
50
(CHARGING SCREAM)
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - They react in wide eyed fear.
JOY
51
Gizmo! Titanium-Pod! 
Chris and Joy dive to the ground and Gizmo covers them with 
the Titanium Shield Pod - Shield (REUSE Design P501 from #113 
simply called Gizmo’s Shield in that episode)
Sabean #1 reaches the Pod and flails on it with his sword. 
<CLANKING-CLATTERING-STRIKING SFX>
SABEAN #1
52
*
(striking efforts)
*
GIZMO/CHRIS/JOY
53
*
(Muffled screams) Ah! Ow! Oh!
*
ANGLE SATAN - Watching a herd of Oxen stampede off below him.
SATAN
54
Job’s five hundred yoke of oxen! 
*
Stolen?  Too bad. - And now the 
*
outlook is cloudy with a chance 
of... FIRE! 
He thrusts his fists in the air. <WHOOSH> - They spew flames.
ANGLE ON THE CLOUDS - Two flames-lines <RIP> up into the 
clouds. <EXPLOSION>  - Fireballs - like bowling ball size 
meteors - begin to hurtle down on earth.
INSIDE GIZMO’S TITANIUM POD - Gizmo’s faceplate lights the 
*
space. The kids duck and react to every <SWORD STRIKE SFX>.
CHRIS
55
Oh man, my week can’t get any worse 
than THIS!
*
As Chris says his line, Gizmo extends a telescoping viewing 
tube from his head (Reuse from #106) and it connects to a 
small portal OPENING on the end of the pod (Not where Sabean 
#1 is striking them from above.)  He sees...
GIZMO (O.C.)
56
*
Uh, Chris...
*
OUTSIDE POD ON SABEAN #1 - Fireballs begin to pelt down in 
the BG.  He stops striking the pod - looks to the sky -
Hundreds of fireballs <RIIIIP> towards earth. <BOOOOM>  A 
fireball crashes and fill frame.
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    8
 SABEAN #1
57
(SCREAM)
*
OUTSIDE POD - FIREBALLS PELT the earth all around them. 
*
Gizmo’s head and arms “transform” through the end of the pod.  
The pod is now Gizmo’s “body”.
GIZMO
58
*
Ohhh....
*
Gizmo’s arms stretch forward.  The carbide boring bits flips 
*
open in his hands (Design (511 Isometric Boring Attachment 
Episode #113) - <WHIRRRRRR>   His aims his outstretched arms 
at the earth and digs downward disappearing into the hole 
he’s boring - taking the pod-bod with him.
ANGLE ON SHEEP - They <BLEAT> and scatter as FIREBALLS rain 
down all around them with <EXPLOSIONS>
CUTAWAY OF EARTH - Gizmo powers his way through the earth 
with his faceplate LIGHTING the way. -  He levels off and 
continues on a horizontal dig. 
The Screen rotates clockwise and the tunnel match dissolves 
*
into a tree in a forest. Satan lands next to the tree.
*
SATAN
59
*
Now, let me think... My deal with 
God was not to harm Job. 
(push in close)
But he never said anything about 
*
his sons and daughters.  
*
EXT. JOB’S SON’S HOUSE - IN THE DISTANCE - CONTINUOUS
*
From a distance we ONLY SEE silhouettes of people - NO NEW 
*
MODELS FOR THESE CHARACTERS -  in the windows eating and 
*
drinking at dinner (CAN REUSE BODIES OF JOB’S SECOND FAMILY 
*
SEEN AT END OF SCRIPT - THEY ARE ND AS SILHOUETTES)
*

*
(dinner walla)
*
BACK ON SATAN
*
SATAN
61
*
(laughing)
*
Satan whips into a massive funnel cloud and it starts to race *
forward.  <WHOOOSHING SFX>
*
The WIND FUNNEL appears ominously above the house and then 
speeds downward. The base of the funnel divides into four 
legs.  Each one of the wind legs shoots for one of the four 
corners of the house - ripping the corners open so the roof 
and walls all cave in.  
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    9
 <CRASHING SOUNDS AND SCREAMS> (NOTE: IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO 
DISTINGUISH THIS WIND FUNNEL FROM THE ONE AT THE END OF THE 
EPISODE WHEN GOD APPEARS TO JOB - THIS ONE COULD BE DARK AND 
OILY AND CONTAIN BLACK SMOKE)
SATAN (CONT’D)
62
*
(Laughing)
*
EXT. BEHIND JOB’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Gizmo powers up through the earth with the pod.  As he 
coverts - opening to release Joy and Chris - he says.
GIZMO
63
This appears to be a safe distance 
from... 
He is cut off as he hears voices.  
SERVANT #1 (O.C.)
Master!  Master!
JOB (O.C.)
What is it?  What is 
happening?!
*
The kids whirl. ANGLE SHIFT TO - JOB and JOB’S WIFE stand at 
the road.  The sky is still raining fire in the distance. 
Servant #1 is running up the road.  
SERVANT #1
64
The oxen were plowing and the 
donkeys feeding beside them, when 
the Sabeans raided them and took 
them away - (blubber sound) 
*
The kids hurry over as the Servant falls to his knees.
*
SERVANT #1 (CONT’D)
... indeed they have killed 
the servants with the edge of 
*
the sword; and I alone have 
*
escaped to tell you!"  
SERVANT #2 (O.C.)
Master!  My master!
*
Servant #2 is running towards them.
*
SERVANT #2 (NLT JOB 1:16)
65
*
The fire of God fell from heaven 
and burned up the sheep and the 
servants, and consumed them; and I 
alone have escaped to tell you!  
ON JOB’S STUNNED REACTION - Servant #3 races in and falls at 
*
Job’s feet - overlapping.
*
SERVANT #3 (CEV JOB 1:17)
66
*
Three gangs of Chaldeans attacked 
and stole your camels! 
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    10
(MORE)
 All of your other servants were 
killed, and I am the only one who 
escaped to tell you. 
Overlapping...
SERVANT #4 (NLT)
67
*
Your sons and daughters were 
*
feasting in their oldest brother’s 
*
home.  Suddenly, a powerful wind 
*
swept in from the wilderness and 
*
hit the house on all sides. The 
*
house collapsed, and all your 
*
children are dead. 
*
ANGLE ON  - Chris, Joy and Gizmo stare - stunned - 
JOB’S WIFE (O.C.)
Noooo!!  Our children! 
(sobbing)  
SERVANT #4
*
I am the only one who escaped 
*
to tell you.
*
*
JOB’S WIFE
68
*
Why has this happened?! (crying to 
*
carry through scene)
*
ANGLE ON JOB - assisting his wife, who has fallen to her 
knees. The servants move in to console her.  
JOB rises - he looks heavenward - tears form in his eyes and 
he grabs the top/front of his garment and <TEARS> it.
JOB
69
(anguished tearing effort)
PUSH IN ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - as they watch the O.C. 
action and hear Job’s wife continue to sob.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. JOB’S HOUSE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Job has shaved his head.  He bows before an altar with an 
offering still burning.  ANGLE ADJUSTS TO REVEAL - A short 
distance away, Chris Joy and Gizmo are near Job’s well with 
Servant #1 and Servant #2 and Job’s wife.  They watch Job.  
*
CLOSE ON JOB - on the ground - praying.
JOB (JOB 1:21)
70
The Lord gave, and the Lord has 
*
taken away...

 JOB (CONT’D)
71
... blessed be the name of the 
Lord. 
JOB’S WIFE
72
*
He should be angry with God for 
*
what has happened, but instead he 
*
praises Him.
*
His wife turns and storms into the house.  Chris watches her 
*
go and then turns back to look at Job praising God and 
*
weeping.
*
JOB
73
*
(weeping)
*
PUSH IN ON CHRIS - watching - absorbing - witnessing.  
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. JOB’S HOUSE - THE WELL - DUSK
The burnt offering has finished burning on the altar. 
*
There is a stand of tree and some boulders.  Satan peers out, *
looking towards Job, sitting by the tree in his yard. Job 
leans with his head bowed and shoulders slumped, the picture 
of dejection. (Hooking to previous shot) Joy and Gizmo are 
exiting into the house. Chris and the Servant draw water.
SATAN
74
Broken.  Battered and beleaguered.  
(looking upwards with a 
cocky sneer)
Sorry, God.  I’m about to win our 
challenge.
*
<WHOOSH> he morphs into TRAVELER’S DISGUISE (POSSIBLY REUSE 
“NAYSAYER” MODEL FROM EPISODE #109)
ANGLE NEAR WELL - Servant #1 turns to carry the water to the 
house as SATAN/TRAVELER approaches. 
SATAN/TRAVELER
75
Would the master of the house have 
anything to spare a weary traveler? 
SERVANT #1
76
Sadly, my master is in mourning and 
has lost everything he had.  There 
is barely enough for the members of 
the household.
Servant #1 exits.  Satan turns to Chris - enjoying it.
SATAN/TRAVELER
77
Is this true?  
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    12
 Chris nods sadly and sits on the edge of the well.  
CHRIS
78
He lost everything in one day.  His 
family.... His fortune...
*
Satan/Traveler eyes Job with a smile of satisfaction.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
79
I mean I have stuff that’s happened 
to me... really bad stuff...
SATAN/TRAVELER
80
That God has allowed to happen?  
Tsk... How can God do that?
(looking at Job)
Job must surely hate God now. 
*
CHRIS
81
That’s the amazing part.  With 
88
*
everything that’s happened, he 
still praises God. 
Chris takes a jug to the house.  PUSH IN - Satan is livid.
*
SATAN/TRAVELER
82
This cannot be!  
SATAN’S POV OF JOB

83
No one loses their fortune, their 
*
family, everything in this world...
*
BACK ON SATAN 
*
SATAN/TRAVELER (CONT’D (CONT’D)
84
... yet does not turn to God to 
blame or ask WHY?  
Satan whirls angrily for the road.  As he strides away, he  
morphs from the Traveler into his Satan and rockets towards 
*
Heaven. CAMERA RISES AND TRACKS him as he call Heavenward...
*
SATAN
85
GOD!!  JOB, WILL YET DENY YOU!

into the clouds.

From where do you come?

SATAN
87
From going to and fro on the Earth, 
and from walking back and forth on 
it.

Have you considered my servant Job, 
that there is none like him on the 
Earth, a blameless and upright man.

CLOSE ON SATAN - He seethes.
GOD (O.C.) (JOB 2:3)(CONT’D)

*
And he holds fast to his integrity,

Satan raises a fist up near his face.  His fist glows red hot 
like embers within.

90
Skin for skin!

ON SATAN - he smiles self-assured
GOD (O.C.)

... but spare his life. 
Satan cocks his eyebrow - accepting - but with a plan - then

Job will feel so much pain he will 
curse God for giving him the very 
breath of life! 
Approaching Earth - Satan whip-morphs into his traveler’s 
disguise as <WHOOOSH> a great Batman-esque one-knee-dipped-
landing on THE ROAD PASSING JOB’S HOUSE.  He rises - gets his 
bearings - then strides towards the house, his traveler’s 
cape whipping dramatically - all business.
EXT. JOB’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Satan walks into frame looking at the house - then with a 
sudden <WHOOSH> he shoots up onto the roof.
ANGLE ON JOB’S ROOFTOP - Satan lands down. He strides to the 
middle of the roof and slowly raises his arms in front of 
himself with palms open, facing downward.  A LIGHT begins to 
emanate from his palms towards the roof.  A low, vibrating 
<HUUUUMMMMM> begins to grow.
INT. SERVANT’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
Chris, Joy and Gizmo are asleep.  Servants #1, #2, #3 and #4 
also sleep nearby.  There is a slight-steady tremor that

upright and his face plate FLASHES ON providing light.

The servant’s and Job’s wife can be HEARD but not seen inside

(Note - all have been used in the episode except for the 
first section describing Job and his world and possessions.  
We will learn this during the episode.) 
JOB 1
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and 
that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God 
and shunned evil. 2 And seven sons and three daughters were 
born to him. 3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand 
sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five 
hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that 
this man was the greatest of all the people of the East. 
4 And his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on 
his appointed day, and would send and invite their three 
sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 So it was, when the 
days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send 
and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and 
offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. 
For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed 
God in their hearts." Thus Job did regularly. 
6 Satan Attacks Job's Character 
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present 
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. 7 
And the LORD said to Satan, "From where do you come?" So 
Satan answered the LORD and said, "From going to and fro on 
the earth, and from walking back and forth on it. 8 Then the 
LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that 
there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright 
man, one who fears God and shuns evil?"  9 So Satan answered 
the LORD and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing? 10 Have 
You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and 
around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the 
work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the 
land. 11 But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he 
has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!" 12 And the 
LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your 
power; only do not lay a hand on his person." So Satan went 
out from the presence of the LORD. 
13 Job Loses His Property and Children
Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating 
and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house; 
SB 208 "My Servant Job"   REV Anicon Script 10-08-12    31
 14 and a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were 
plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 15 when the 
Sabeans raided them and took them away - indeed they have 
killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone 
have escaped to tell you!"  16 While he was still speaking, 
another also came and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven 
and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; 
and I alone have escaped to tell you!"  17 While he was still 
speaking, another also came and said, "The Chaldeans formed 
three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and 
killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone 
have escaped to tell you!"  18 While he was still speaking, 
another also came and said,"Your sons and daughters were 
eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, 19 
and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and 
struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the 
young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to 
tell you!" 
20 Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he 
fell to the ground and worshiped. 21 And he said: "Naked I 
came from my mother's womb, And naked shall I return there. 
The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; Blessed be the 
name of the LORD."  22 In all this Job did not sin nor charge 
God with wrong. 
NKJV
Job 2:1-10
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present 
themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to 
present himself before the LORD. 2 And the LORD said to 
Satan, "From where do you come?" Satan answered the LORD and 
said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking 
back and forth on it."  3 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have 
you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on 
the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and 
shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, 
although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without 
cause."  4 So Satan answered the LORD and said, "Skin for 
skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 5 
But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his 
flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!"  6 And the 
LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand, but spare 
his life."  
7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck 
Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown 
of his head. 
8 And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape 
himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.  9 Then his 
wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast to your integrity? 
Curse God and die!" 
10 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women 
speaks.

 Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept 
adversity?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips. 
NKJV
Job 3:11
1 "Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I 
came from the womb? 
NKJV
Job 3:24-26 - 24 For my sighing comes before I eat,   And my 
groanings pour out like water. 
25 For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me,  And what 
I dreaded has happened to me.  26 I am not at ease, nor am I 
quiet;  I have no rest, for trouble comes." 
NKJV
Job 19:23-27
3 "Oh, that my words were written!  Oh, that they were 
inscribed in a book!  24 That they were engraved on a rock  
With an iron pen and lead, forever!   25 For I know that my 
Redeemer lives,  And He shall stand at last on the earth;   
26 And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,  That in my 
flesh I shall see God,   27 Whom I shall see for myself,  And 
my eyes shall behold, and not another.  How my heart yearns 
within me! 
NKJV
Job 38:1-11
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 
2 "Who is this who darkens counsel By words without 
knowledge? 3 Now prepare yourself like a man;I will question 
you, and you shall answer Me.   4 "Where were you when I laid 
the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have 
understanding. 5 Who determined its measurements? Surely you 
know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 6 To what were its 
foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 7 When the 
morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted 
for joy? 
8 "Or who shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth and 
issued from the womb; 9 When I made the clouds its garment, 
And thick darkness its swaddling band; 10 When I fixed My 
limit for it, And set bars and doors; 11 When I said, 'This 
far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves 
must stop!' 
NKJV Job 40:1-9 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:  2 
"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him  He 
who rebukes God, let him answer it."

 3 Job's Response to God 
Then Job answered the LORD and said:  4 "Behold, I am vile; 
What shall I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth.  5 Once 
I have spoken, but I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will 
proceed no further." 
6 God's Challenge to Job 
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:  7 
"Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and 
you shall answer Me:  8 "Would you indeed annul My judgment? 
Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? 9 Have you an 
arm like God?
(NKJV Job 42:1-6 )- 2 "I know that You can do everything, And 
that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.  3 You 
asked, 'Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?' 
Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, Things 
too wonderful for me, which I did not know.: 4 Listen, 
please, and let me speak; You said, 'I will question you, and 
you shall answer Me.' 5 "I have heard of You by the hearing 
of the ear,…  But now my eye sees You.  6 Therefore I abhor 
myself, And repent in dust and ashes."   
NKJV
Job 42:10-17
10 And the LORD restored Job's losses when he prayed for his 
friends.   Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had 
before. 11 Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all 
those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and 
ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and 
comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought 
upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring 
of gold. 
12 Now the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his 
beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand 
camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female 
donkeys. 13 He also had seven sons and three daughters. 14 
And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the 
second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. 15 In 
all the land were found no women so beautiful as the 
daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance 
among their brothers. 
16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw 
his children and grandchildren for four generations. 17 So 
Job died, old and full of days.

(CEV) JOB 38: 1-11
From out of a storm, the LORD said to Job:  Why do you talk 
so much when you know so little?  Now get ready to face me! 
Can you answer the questions I ask?  How did I lay the 
foundation for the earth?  Were you there? 5Doubtless you 
know who decided its length and width. 6What supports the 
foundation? Who placed the cornerstone,  7while morning stars 
sang, and angels rejoiced? 8When the ocean was born, I set 
its boundaries 9and wrapped it in blankets of thickest fog. 
10Then I built a wall around it, locked the gates, 11and 
said, "Your powerful waves stop here! They can go no 
farther."
