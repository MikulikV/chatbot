Episode #209
"Covenant of the Storm"
SIGNPOST - [GENESIS 7:1 NKJV]
Come into the Ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you 
are righteous before Me in this generation.
CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: God does not always protect us from trouble but cares 
for us in spite of trouble
SYNOPSIS:
When GIZMO catches CHRIS and JOY skipping school to hang out with a bad role 
model (PEARCE, the leader of an extreme skateboarding team), SUPERBOOK sends 
them back to a time when the world was fraught with evil.  So evil, in fact, 
that God vows to destroy the world, saving only Noah (“The only righteous man 
on earth”), his family and a menagerie of animal species.  As they witness 
the Flood -- and Noah's unwavering faith in God -- our heroes see how their 
bad behavior paralleled the world's descent into sin.  Heartened by Noah's 
example and God's covenant with Mankind (to never again destroy the world 
with a flood), they return to the present and reject Pearce's dangerous 
influence.

The wickedness of humankind is

great.  Everything they think and

plan is evil.

GIZMO

Gaaa... Save me!
*
Joy backs away and angrily indicates Chris.
*
JOY
21
*
Get him to save you!
*
(glares at Chris)
*
It was his idea to skip school!
CHRIS
22
Oh?  Well you were right there 
with me!  ‘Cuz you were crushin’ 
all over Pearce!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SKATE PARK - MORNING (FLASHBACK)
Joy frets as Chris peels back the perimeter fence and 
climbs through, holding his UNI-BALL SKATEBOARD.
JOY
23
Chris, are you sure about this? 
17
School starts in half an hour!
CHRIS
24
You have first period study hall -- 
(beat, mutters)
-- and I have a note from Mom.
JOY

You forged a note from your mom?
CHRIS

(sotto, urgently)
Relax, will you?  It’s no big 
deal!

 REVEAL - GIZMO - stands behind them holding an insulated 
lunch bag.  
GIZMO (CONT’D)
28
Chris, you left your lunch at 
home.  Again.  I went to school to 
give it to you, but you were not 
there.  So, I used my GPS to track 
you here... where you appear to be 
breaking into the Skateboard Park 
before it opens?
CHRIS
29
Uh, Giz, listen, we’re kinda busy -
-
REVERSE FAVORING PEARCE - an edgy skateboarder type and 
*
his gang.
*
PEARCE
30
Heeey, Quantum.  You ready?
CHRIS
31
*
You bet!
Pearce shoots a signal jammer at the gate lock and it 
*
pops open.  Chris is impressed.
*
CHRIS
32
*
Woah...
*
Joy shoots a blushing smile up at Pearce as she passes.
JOY
33
Hi Pearce.
Then she shoots Chris  alook, wanting an introduction.
*
JOY
34
*
Ah-hem...
*
It takes Chris a beat to get  what she wants.
*
CHRIS
35
Huh?... Oh, Pearce, uh you uh... 
*
you know Joy?
Joy stand there and lowers her eyes as she clasps her 
hands in front of her shyly.
PEARCE - gives her a cursory nod, then addresses Chris.
PEARCE
36
Oh... Hey.
*
(to Chris, coolly)
This way, Quantum.  Let’s see what 
you got.
UPPER RIM OF BOWL - adjacent to a CONCRETE COLUMN.  
SKATEBOARDERS #1 and #2 stand with uni-ball boards to 
which are attached TWIN ROCKETS.  Our heroes step up with 
Pearce.

 CHRIS
37
Your skateboards have rockets?
PEARCE
38
*
Ha... Those nitro-blasters are how 
*
my team’s going to win the Insane 
*
Games next week.  You think you’re 
*
tough enough to ride with us?
*
CHRIS
39
*
Uh... yeah... welll...
*
PEARCE
40
*
Show him what it takes, Zena.
*
Zena steps up and pulls out a pair of dark glasses.  They 
*
look like Chris Holo-9 VR glasses but a different trim 
*
line and color.  She reaches forward to put them on 
*
Chris’ face.
*
CHRIS’ POV
*
Zena puts the glasses on his face as we see VIDEO PLAYING 
*
INSIDE THE LENSES while we also still see Zen and Pearce 
*
over the top of the lenses.
*
PEARCE (CONT’D)
41
*
We shot this video on a street run 
*
last week. 
*
Zena pushes the glasses fully up on Chris eyes and now we 
*
see nothing but the video.
*
EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY (VIDEO)
*
MUSIC COME UP - HARD DRIVING - Pearce and Skateboarder #3 
*
stand atop a van that’s parked outside the mall. Pearce 
*
carries a baseball bat-like club.  Skateboarder #3 has a 
*
chain and is whipping it in a slow circle, ready for 
*
action.  Pearce is hunkered down, eyeing #3 and slowly 
*
pounding the head of the bat down on the roof of the van.  
*
Zena tosses her drone cam in the air and it rises over 
*
the truck.  (VARIOUS ANGLES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE 
*
CHASE, DUE TO HER HELMET CAM AND THE DRONE CAM)
*
TRACKING PEARCE AND #2
*
They eye one another and then speed off across the roof 
*
of the van.
*
They LEAP off the end of the van.  While in mid air #2 
*
swings the chain at Pearce and Pearce lifts his lefts up 
*
to avid the swing.
*
LOW ON CAR ROOF 
*
Both boarders slam down on the roof of a nearby car and 
*
then speed down the windshield and across the hood.   
*
Pearce swings the bat at #3 and he ducks as the bat 
*
misses.
*

 LOW ANGLE UP
*
The two boarders fliw OVER CAMERA as CAM ANGLE WITH THEM 
*
and the land on the rear windshield of another car.  It 
*
CRACKS under the impact and they fly O.C.
*
ANGLE ON ANOTHER CAR ROOF
*
Both riders land.  As the do, Pearce swings the bat at 
*
#3’s board and it shoots out from beneath his feet.
*
ON #3 
*
He flies up in the air off his board.
*
ON PEARCE
*
He zooms away, looking back and laughing
*
PEARCE
42
*
(laughing)
*
ON #3
*
He <SMASHES> down on the windshield of a car - the 
*
windshield cracks but he’s okay.  He sits up as the CAR 
*
ALARM GOES OFF.  He quickly rolls off the car.
*
ANGLE NEAR MALL ENTRANCE
*
Pearce 360’s to a stop near Zena.  #3 races up. They high 
*
five.  Suddenly a Mall Guard runs out and the kids take 
*
off.
*
PEARCE
43
*
Awright!  Huh?  Beat it!  
*
Security! 
*
SUDDENLY THE GLASSES ARE PULLED OFF CHRIS’ FACE - we’re 
*
looking at Pearce.  He thrusts the skateboard at Chris 
*
and in place of “Your turn.” he’ll now say...
*
PEARCE (CONT’D)
44
*
Show’s over.  Now, let see what 
*
YOU got.
*
GIZMO
45
*
Oh Chri-is.... can we talk?
*
He ushers Chris off.  Joy follows, giving Pearce a smile.
*
JOY
46
*
Excuse us a second.
*
AROUND THE CORNER - OUT OF SIGHT OF THE GANG
*
Gizmo chides Chris.

This is very very dangerous!
CHRIS
50
That’s why they’re called the 
Skateboard Maniacs -- they’re the 
hottest team in town!  And they 
want me to join before the Insane 
Games!
GIZMO
51
Why do the words maniac and insane 
not worry you?  Can’t you see that 
this Pearce person is violent?!
*
JOY
52
(beat, sheepish)
I think he’s cute.
Gizmo clutches his face in his hands, exasperated.
GIZMO

GIZMO

And Superbook said we would me a

righteous man who walked in 
*
fellowship with God.
*
JOY
55
*
Well, I can tell you one thing, if 
*
there S a righteous man left on 
*
earth, he ISN’T in this town.
*
They hear a Marauder approaching
*
GIZMO
56
Ooo.

 But as he lunges, they bolt -- Chris to one side of the 
man, Joy to the other and Gizmo <ZIPS> between his legs.  
MOVING WITH CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - 
*
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
59
*
RUN! (screams)
*
ANOTHER STREET
*
The kids round the corner and flee.
*
GIZMO
60
*
I’d like to stay and protect you 
*
guys but...
*
JOY
61
*
Do you know where you’re going?
*
GIZMO
62
*
Anywhere but here!
*
The camera pulls up above the burning town as the kids 
*
flee into countryside beyond.

CUT TO:
EXT. NOAH’S LAND AND HOME - DAY
[CBN DESIGN NOTE:  Noah’s home land landscape -- a 
slightly greener version of Babylon/Iraq.  Before the 
flood, the Bible says a “mist” came up from the earth and 
watered things, so it was probably greener than the 
Middle East today.] Chris, Joy and Gizmo WALK ALONG. 
*
JOY
63
*
I still don’t understand why 
*
Superbook would dump us in the 
*
middle of a town where everyone 
*
was trying to kill each other.
*
GIZMO
64
*
Yes!  Especially if he was trying 
*
to introduce us to someone who 
*
walked in fellowship with God.
*
Chris looks off in awe.
*
CHRIS
65
Whoa... Guys, I think I found our 
*
man.  
*
REVERSE ANGLE AT TOP OF NEXT RIDGE - A BRILLIANT WHITE 
*
LIGHT from above bathes NOAH, an white-bearded man 
kneeling in the sand.

 GOD (V.O.) 
66
Build an ark from cypress wood and 
waterproof it with tar, inside and 
out.
BACK ON THE KIDS - 
They look on.
*
CHRIS
67
*
What’s an ark?
*
GIZMO
68
*
My records indicate an “ark” is 
*
described in the bible as a large 
*
boat built by Noah.
*
GIZMO’S VIEW SCREEN shows a WIRE FRAME SCHEMATIC of the 
Ark.  (When God lists the cubits we can show measurements 
in feet 450 feet long - 75 feet wide - 45 feet high - 
Have the wire frame turn and give us an exciting visual 
as we hear...
GOD (V.O.)(CONT’D)
69
The length of the ark shall be 
three hundred cubits, its width 
fifty cubits, and its height 
thirty cubits. You shall make a 
window for the ark, and you shall 
finish it to a cubit from above; 
and set the door of the ark in its 
side. You shall make it with 
lower, second, and third decks. 
ANGLE ON NOAH - Looking upwards - 
GOD (V.O.) [GENESIS 6:17 NLT] 
70
(CONT’D)
Look!  I am about to cover the 
earth with a flood that will 
destroy every living thing that 
breathes.  Everything on earth 
will die.
ON CHRIS AND JOY - INTENSE CONCERN LOOKING AT THE SCREEN
Chris turns and looks at the Marauder Village in the 
*
distance, contemplating what this means.
*
DISSOLVE TO:
*
A SHORT TIME LATER - 
*
Chris, Joy, Gizmo and Noah’s family are meeting.
*
GOD (V.O.) [GENESIS 6:18 NKJV] 
71
*
But I will establish My covenant 
with you, and you shall go into 
the ark you, your sons, your wife 
and your sons’ wives with you.

X-DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. NOAH’S LAND / EXT. ARK - DAY (MOS MONTAGE)
IN TREE AREA - Joy watches Ham, Shem and Japheth march 
*
by, each easily shouldering a huge section of cypress 
tree (gopherwood in NKJV) and each carrying a FLINT AXE 
with a wooden handle.  ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Chris straining 
to lift a thinner tree with his scrawny arms.  His cheeks 
flush; he grits his teeth.  Joy rolls her eyes.
NOAH’S ARK - begins to take shape in QUICK LAP DISSOLVES.  
A berth to support it.  Ribs of bent timber.  Planks of 
wood.
PAN ALONG SIDE OF ARK - the brothers use Early Bronze Age 
tools - animal bone - or sharpened stone (flint) to shape 
and install a plank with pegs - no nails.
AT STERN OF ARK - out of view, Gizmo stands on a 
primitive ladder.  One of his hands becomes a POWER TOOL.  
He moves to drill a hole in a plank but the drill bit 
gets stuck.  Gizmo spins around like a flywheel and then 
sails OFF-CAMERA.
GIZMO
72
*
WHOAAAA....
*
(then)
*
I’m okay!
*
Then the motor falls O.C. And hits him.
*
GIZMO
73
*
Ooofff!
*
THE WIVES - stir a large VAT OF TAR OVER A FIRE. (the 
“pitch” referenced in Genesis 6:14 NKJV).
AT SIDE OF ARK - Ham, Shem and Japheth slather the tar on 
the outer wall of the ship with branches to make the Ark 
watertight.
CHRIS pounds a peg. WIDEN OUT as Gizmo carries pile of 
*
lumber.
*
GIZMO
74
*
Lalalala...
*
(starting to fall)
*
Whoaaa... (scream)
*
He falls off the deck and the lumber lands on the deck 
*
but teeters there.  Hi arm rises INTO FRAME.
*
GIZMO
75
*
I’m still god!
*
But then the wood falls off the deck and O.C. Obviously 
*
hitting him.

And, by the way, my instruments 
show no sign of potential 
precipitation.
JOY
80
Gizmo, God said He would cause a 
flood.  My guess is, your 
instruments are wrong.
GIZMO
81
Humph!
Then they startle as GOD delivers our SIGNPOST:

Come into the ark...

 GIZMO - stands holding a clipboard and pen.  He calls 
*
over the BARNYARD CACOPHONY: (Animals are not boarding 
*
the ark yet.)

GIZMO

Sacrificial animals to the right,

squints up as:

RESUME GIZMO - a small WINDSHIELD WIPER pops out and
