FADE IN:
EXT. TEMPLE OF BAAL - SAMARIA - WIDE EST. SHOT - AFTERNOON
^
The surrounding land is green and fertile. PROPHET #1 and #2 
^
pass wood up to #3 on the altar top. # 4 lights a flaming 
^
pot, one of two on either side of the altar. PUSH IN TOWARDS 
^
THE ENTRANCE as we hear...
^
JEZEBEL (O.S.)
1
It is a beautiful Temple, Ahab.
INT. TEMPLE OF BAAL - CONTINUOUS
^
CAMERA IS HIGH-ARCING around an imposing STATUE OF BAAL.
^
AHAB (O.C.)
2
^
A beautiful temple for a beautiful
^
queen.
CAMERA slows as it ANGLES DOWNWARD to pick up QUEEN JEZEBEL 
^
and KING AHAB standing below, looking up. Shafts of LIGHT 
^
from the high windows illuminate with dramatic spin spots.
^
AHAB (CONT’D)
3
^
I hope now you won’t be so homesick
^
for Phoenicia.
^
     (indicating all around)
^
Here, you can worship your god, 
^
Baal, whenever you desire.
^
CLOSER - UP ANGLE ON AHAB and JEZEBEL
^
(Keep statue looming large above) - Ahab turns from the 
^
statue to Jezebel
AHAB (CONT’D)
4
And perhaps you will finally
embrace your new home, with me,
here in Israel.
 She turns and places her hands up around Ahab’s neck - 
^
smiling - but remaining a step or two away from him.
^
JEZEBEL
5
Is Baal to be worshipped by me
^
alone, Ahab? - Because I grow weary
of your people’s talk of there
being only ONE true God.
He eases one step in - closer to her.
^
AHAB
6
^
Your god is being worshiped 
^
throughout ALL of Israel, my queen.
^
They ease towards one another about to kiss...
^
7  PROPHETS (O.C.)
(Frightened walla)
8  ELIJAH (O.C.)
KING AHAB!
^
They startle at the assaulting voice. King Ahab’s look 
^
darkens. Jezebel scowls, her beauty vanishing, as she 
^
suddenly looks sinister.
^
EXT. ENTRANCE TO TEMPLE OF BAAL - CONTINUOUS
^
The FOUR PROPHETS scurry from some O.C. menace.
^
9  JEZEBEL (O.C.)
Who dares to speak to the
King of Israel this way?!
10  PROPHETS
(continued frightened walla)
^
Ahab and Jezebel storm out amidst the frightened PROPHETS 
^
They stop short at what they see O.C.
^
11 AHAB/JEZEBEL
(startled gasps)
12  PROPHET #1
It is Elijah, prophet of the 
Lord!
^
WHIP PAN TO THEIR POV
^
ELIJAH - A tall, brawny man with a scraggly beard wearing 
^
dark camel fur and a leather belt.
^
He is holding a staff and is just finishing a leap up ON TOP 
^
OF the altar. He stands and raises his staff in defiance.
^
ELIJAH (PP NKJV&CEV 1K 16:30-33)
13
^
You have done evil in the sight of 
the Lord. 
SB #302 Elijah/Baal - Recording Draft 8-13-12   
2.
(MORE)
 You have built temples and altars 
^
to the false god, Baal, and have 
^
done more to make the Lord God of 
Israel angry than any king of 
Israel before you!
CLOSE ON AHAB AND JEZEBEL
^
Ahab is about to step forward to protest but Elijah’s VOICE 
^
BOOMS, more intensely, and this stops Ahab short.
^
ELIJAH (O.C.)(CEV 1K 17:1)(CONT’D)
14
^
I AM THE SERVANT OF THE LIVING 
^
LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL!
^
ON ELIJAH
^
Arms raised -throwing head back, calling to God.
^
ELIJAH (CEV 1K 17:1)(CONT’D)
15
^
AND I SWEAR IN HIS NAME THAT IT 
^
WON’T RAIN UNTIL I SAY SO!
^
(leaping effort)
^
Elijah leaps off the altar.
^
ON AHAB, JEZEBEL AND THE PROPHETS
^
They startle back, raising hands, fearing an attack.
^
AHAB/JEZEBEL/PROPHETS
16
^
(fearful reactions and walla)
^
ON ELIJAH
^
He’s not going for them. Instead, he swings his staff...
^
ELIJAH
17
^
(swing effort)
^
<CRAAASH> It knocks over a flaming pot. The embers and flames ^
burn on a small area but don’t threaten anything larger, as 
^
Elijah storms away, calling back...
^
ELIJAH (CEV 1K 17:1)(CONT’D)
18
^
THERE WON’T EVEN BE ANY DEW ON THE 
^
GROUND! 
^
^
ANGLE ON - PUSH IN ON JEZEBEL
^
She is aghast and screams after the departing Prophet.

 JEZEBEL

^
I don’t need your God for rain,
^
Prophet! Do you really think Him a
^
match for Baal, the god of weather! 
^
The camera jibs up and pans HIGH AND WIDE to see the fertile 
^
landscape beyond the temple, as Elijah walks into the 
^
wilderness. <MUSIC CRESCENDOS> as we...
^
CROSS DISSOLVE:
^
SAME - THREE YEARS LATER - LANDSCAPE NOW DROUGHT RIDDEN
^
ELIJAH VANISHES - SMOKE RISES THROUGH FRAME. The camera 
^
follows smoke down to reveal the remnants of a BURNING 
^
SACRIFICE on the ALTAR. The landscape all around is blighted. ^
The characters look more gaunt - weary - and
^
AHAB (O.C.)
20
^
Increase the sacrifices until Baal
^
hears our pleas for rain!
^
FAVOR AHAB, JEZEBEL, AND PRIEST #1, PRIEST #2, PRIEST#3 AND 
^
PRIEST #4 Ahab keeps looking up to the cloudless sky.

for this drought!

And if you find any other prophets

of the Lord,... kill them.

 FADE IN:
EXT. VIRTUAL GAMING LANDSCAPE - DUSK
^
A few <EXPLOSIONS> ROCK the screen.  CHRIS WHISKS INTO FRAME, ^
RIDING ON GIZMO. Giz is prone - flying - boot blasters 
^
jetting - he has a steel “deck” on his back like a scooter 
^
deck. Chris stands on the deck holding a stem with handlebars ^
that rises upwards from the back of his neck.  Chris rides 
^
him like a flying scooter.  (Joe, Gordon wants this to play 
^
like a multi-player game and used the word “Anime-Style”.)  
^
CHRIS
24
^
They’re gaining on us, Giz!
^
CAMERA MOVES AROUND TO THE FRONT OF CHRIS AND GIZMO
^
They are being chased by the 3 FLYING CHARIOTS. ALEC (12) is 
^
the closest and he’s firing lighting bolts at them FROM A 
^
TRIDENT. <BLASTING SFX>   Chris ducks as the BLASTS shoot by.  ^
GIZMO
25
^
I see the trident! 
^
He shoves the handlebar forward for more speed. They ZIP OUT 
^
OF FRAME with the extra speed.  The pursuers follow.
^
ON GIZMO’S FACE PLATE
^
We see a REFLECTION of a small island in the middle of a 
^
lake. In the middle of the island is an altar with a fiery 
^
trident hovering mid-air above the altar.
^
GIZMO (CONT’D)
26
^
Chris!  If you can get that Trident 
^
you will become a god of fire! 
^
ON CHRIS - FLYING ALONG
^
<SHHRAACK>  Gizmo takes a lighting bolt to the side. 
^
CHRIS
27
^
Agghhh!  - I’m hit, Giz!  But not 
^
bad. See what you can do with it. 
^
GIZMO

Technically, Chris, I am the one 
^
who was hit...

BLACK OUT:

INT. QUANTUM LAB - AFTERNOON
^
W.S. As Chris rips off his Holo-Nine helmet in frustration. 
CHRIS
33
Oh man!  I can’t believe how close 
^
we were!
He steps off the game platform. Gizmo unplugs wires that run 
^
from his open chest cavity to the game platform.  The door to ^
the lab opens. Joy walks in.
GIZMO
34
I can’t believe I crashed again!
^
JOY
35
Hi guys. Are you still playing...

(goofing on them)
^
“Battleverse of the Goooooods!”

You know what?  You’re obsessed.

You’re NOT onsessed?  You mean

it’s perfectly normal to spend

every waking hour playing this

game...

Each corner has an angry greek like god holding a trident. 
Each trident matches the ones we saw in the virtual world.

Chris jumps out of his seat, and with new conviction he picks ^
his Halo-Nine helmet back up.

EXT. NEAR MOUNT CARMEL - AFTERNOON

The kids drop down near a few wild fig trees. Gizmo opens the ^
geo-sensor on his forearm and walks away from the other two.  ^
GIZM

According to my geo sensors, we are 
^
in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, 
approximately 850 BC.

GIZMO
46
And my thermal sensors indicate it

has not...

branches right above him. Gizmo continues passing under him 
^
until the boy is completely out of view.

GIZMO (CONT’D)
47

... rained here in over three 
^
years.
JOY (O.S.)
48
^
Wow! That’s a long time to go 
without rain.
ON GIZMO
^
He stops - “Thinks” - then he backs up.  He cocks his head 
^
and looks upwards. WIDEN TO INCLUDE TOBIAH (14) slowly lowers ^
his eyes until they meet Gizmo’s.

GIZMO
49
Hello.
<CRACK> as the tree branch Tobiah is on begins to give way.

What were you doing up in the tree?
Chris and Joy ENTER FRAME

I could not believe I found figs - 
in the middle of this drought!

He holds up a branch with a group of fairly shriveled figs.

because I thought you were with 
King Ahab.

Umm-hmmm
GIZMO
74
Okay, dumb question: Why?
CLOSER ON ELIJAH
^
ELIJAH
75
I’ve got a challenge for him - a 
contest.  Israel has been 
^
worshiping the false god, Baal, and 
^
the Lord will prove that He and He 
^
alone is the one true, all powerful 
God.
CLOSE ON CHRIS

CHRIS
76
If he’s all powerful, why doesn’t 
he end this drought?
CLOSE ON ELIJAH AND TOBIAH
^
ELIJAH
77
He will.
TOBIAH
78
^
Really, when?!?
ELIJAH
79
^
Soon, but first Israel must turn 
away from their false gods and back 
to the Lord God - the creator of 
the universe.
Chris moves up to ask...
^
SB #302 Elijah/Baal - Recording Draft 8-13-12   11.
 CHRIS
80
Elijah! Now, what about Baal? What 
^
kind of powers does he have?
^
ELIJAH
81
Powers?
ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
CHRIS
82
Yeah, you know. Can he control the 
^
rain, or shoot lighting, control 
time, replenish health points...
ON ELIJAH
Elijah stops and picks up a rock
^
ELIJAH
83
They take a rock, carve it into an 
idol and call it god.  But it is 
^
still just a rock, shaped by human 
^
hands.
^
Elijah tosses the rock down. He looks out at the horizon.
^
ELIJAH (PP PS135:16-18) (CONT’D)
84
^
The idols have mouths but cannot 
^
speak, and eyes but cannot see.  
^
Anyone who makes and trust in them 
^
will end up as helpless as the 
^
idols are.
^
Just then the loud sound of a <WHINNYING> horse can be heard. ^

They look down to a path 50 yards away.

I’ve never seen this many poeple

REVERSE POV
^
Thousands of people are on the end of the plateau and on the

rise above.  Among the crowd is one group that stands out - 
^
the 450 Prophets of Baal - distinguished by their matching

into the crowd by 64, making up their 450 contingent.

form an alliance and gang up on 
you.
