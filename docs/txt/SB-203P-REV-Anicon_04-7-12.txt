SUPERBOOK
"Tested by Fire"
Episode #203P
Revised Anicon Draft 4-7-12
CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: Obey God (and do the right thing) even 
when everyone else does not. (He will be your protector.)
LOG LINE: Chris wrestles with making a moral decision between 
right and wrong  -- a decision Joy warns could get him in big 
trouble. Superbook takes Chris and his friends back to Babylon 
during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar to meet Shadrach, Meshach and 
Abednego - three men who chose to obey God and trust Him for their 
protection no matter the cost. (Chris is not directly protected by 
God in the end of his story but he does realize he can stand up 
and do the right thing - which is what God wants him to do 
always.)

INT. LABORATORY - DAY
PAN across the quiet lab... DOWN past the PLANET MOBILE, 
centering on the entry door. Suddenly... 
*
CHRIS (O.S.)
1
AAAAAAAHHHhhhhhh!!!!
BAAM! The door flies open. 
CAMERA WHIPS In to MEDIUM of Chris holding a BACKPACK. His 
hair’s a mess. His shirt’s untucked.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
2
GIZ!!! I’M LATE FOR SCHOOL!!!
Chris tosses his backpack - TRACK BACKPACK through the air - 
*
It lands...
*
ANGLE FROM BEHIND CHRIS - TRACKING HIM INTO THE LAB - We hold 
Gizmo in the BG of shot as Chris enters so we can watch 
Gizmo’s activity. Chris heads for the cabinets.
*
CHRIS (CONT’D)
3
You gotta find my books! Pack my 
*
bag! And I’ll -- 
*
Chris pulls out a SMALL MIRROR (Type held upright on it’s own *
stand) and places it on the cabinets -- simultaneously, in 
*
the BG we see Gizmo run to the bookcase on the back wall - 
*
extend his arms and head, and begin pulling BOOKS from the 
shelves. 
OTS TO CHRIS’ REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR - He notices ONE PIECE 
OF HAIR sticking straight out. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
4
*
(sounds of surprise at seeing his 
*
hair)
*
He licks his FINGERS and pushes it down. <BOING>! It pops 
back up. Again he wets it. <BOING>! It pops back up. 
Meanwhile... <BOOM! CLINK! CRASH!> - SHOES, MAGAZINES, TEST 
TUBES and other OBJECTS, thrown by Giz, fly past in the 
*
mirror’s reflection.

 ANGLE ON GIZMO - He drops to his knees looking under the 
*
table for books.
GIZMO

*
Now, if I were Chris’ books, where 
*
would I hide? 
*
His head extends and comes round face-to-end with YIKES! his 
*
own backside. 
GIZMO (CONT’D)
6
Woah!  That’s not a book!
BACK ON CHRIS AT THE MIRROR - He wets his hair a last time. 
It finally stays down. 
ANGLE ARCS AROUND TO REVEAL - Giz running up carrying THREE 
TEXT BOOKS and CHRIS’ BACKPACK.  
CHRIS
7
Got ‘em?
GIZMO
8
Yes. You just need pencils, a 
ruler, your calculator, a note pad, 
*
this protractor and...
<BEEP> 
ANGLE ON HOLOPHONE
Chris’ friends MITCH 10 and JAY, 11, BOTH APPEAR ON THE 
HOLOPHONE IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE VID WINDOWS. 
*
MITCH

*
Hi, Chris.
JAY
10
*
Hey, Chris.
*
ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHRIS, GIZMO AS THEY TURN TO HOLOPHONE 
Gizmo dumps the books into Chris’ backpack then starts 
filling it with PENCILS, PENS, A RULER, A CALCULATOR, A N 
*
UMBRELLA.. A PLUNGER... Chris speaks towards the Holophone, 
*
but is distracted by the endless items Gizmo is producing. 
CHRIS
11
Er-uh, hey Mitch, Jay, what do you 
guys need? I’m late.
CLOSE ON HOLOSCREEN
MITCH

 BACK ON CHRIS AND GIZ - as Chris becomes curious and begins 
to reach into Giz’s chest. 
CHRIS
13
Study for what?
HOLOSCREEN
MITCH
14
The test.
CHRIS AND GIZ stop and look towards the phone stunned.
CHRIS 
15
*
Test?!
<BAAM!> Gizmo’s chest door slams shut on Chris’ finger. He 
jumps up and down trying to pull it out. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
16
ARAGGHH!!  GIZ!!! GIZ!!! OPEN, 
*
OPEN, OPEN!!! - Owww...
*
Giz obliges. Chris retrieves his smarting finger and walks 
away towards the O.C. Holophone. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
17
*
Did you say ‘Test’?
<BOINNG!> His hair pops up one last time. 
GIZMO
18
*
That is correct, Chris.
*
Giz zips INTO FRAME beside him. A SMALL HOSE extends from 
Gizmo’s chest and SQUIRTS Chris in the head. An ARM then 
appears from his chest with a HAIRBRUSH and runs it over 
Chris’ hair  -- finally flattening it. He speaks while this 
happens...
GIZMO (CONT’D)
19
*
Your science test on levers and 
*
fulcrums. 
CHRIS
20
*
(Coughing)
*
The hose and arm RETRACT.
*
CHRIS (CONT’D)
21
Guys, I had band practice.  I 
forgot. 
Gizmo rambles as Chris considers...

 CHRIS (CONT’D)
*
Man, if I don’t get a passing 
*
grade I can’t go to the 
*
amusement park with the 
*
class.
*
GIZMO
Fulcrums are like seesaws. Of *
course the physics are rather *
complicated. Mathematically 
*
it is expressed M=Fd.
**
GIZMO
22
*
Oh, Chris, you are right. And the 
*
amusement park just installed the 
*
most extreme new roller coaster 
*
ever: SCREAMIIING THUNDEEEER!!
*
Gizmo’s faceplate displays a schematic of the roller coaster.
*
CLOSE ON HOLOPHONE SCREEN
MITCH
*
Sweet! 
*
JAY
*
Awesome!

CHRIS
23
*
I gotta ride Screaming Thunder! But 
*
how am I gonna pass that test? Any 
*
ideas?
*
JAY
24
Well, Todd sent this. You might 
want to check it out.
Jay and Mitch disappear with a <BING-HANGUP-SFX) 
INSERT -- QUICK CLOSE SHOT OF CHRIS looking confused.
BACK ON THE HOLOPHONE - a new video call pops up on the from 
TODD, the school bully. 
TODD
25
Hey, any of you losers who forgot 
about the science test... I got the 
answers.
PUSH SLOWLY ON CHRIS - as his interest is peaked.
ANGLE BACK ON HOLOSCREEN. THE NUMBERS 67455 appear on the 
screen.
*
TODD (CONT’D)
26
Just enter this code on your 
DATACOMM 3000 and they’ll download. 
ANGLE ON CHRIS - He pulls out his phone. 
*
TODD (CONT’D)
27
But they aren’t free. You’ll have 
to pay. - Cause my dad cut off my 
allowance.

 <BING-HANGUP-SFX) the call disappears. 
NEW ANGLE - Chris pulls out his “DC3000”  He pauses...then 
*
begins entering numbers. <BEEPING SFX>  He finishes entering 
the code then raises the DC3000, and reads what’s on the 
screen (though we don’t show it). 
CHRIS 
28
TODD’S TEST ANSWERS. Press here to 
purchase and download. 
As Chris reaches towards the screen, Gizmo panics. 
GIZMO (O.C.)
29
NO, CHRIS!!! DO NOT DO IT!!! - OH, 
I CAN NOT WATCH THIS! Doh!
*
GIZ covers his EYES with one hand. His other hand grabs the 
top of his own head, spins it away.
CHRIS
30
Giz, a kid’s got do what a kid’s 
*
got to do.
Chris looks back at the DC3000, holds up the device and 
raises his other hand. His forefinger is poised to hit the 
button - but he pauses and thinks... Giz spins back and 
peeks. <MUSIC SWELLS> 
EXTREME CLOSE ON FINGERTIP - It FILLS THE SCREEN as it 
reaches to the face of the O.C. ‘Download’ button...
FADE TO BLACK.
ACT ONE

FADE IN:
INT. LABORATORY - MORNING 
Chris puts the DC3000 in his pocket.

CHRIS
Okay, got ‘em. And, Giz, not 
*
a word of this to...
*
GIZMO
*
(frantic babble)
*
*
ANGLE ON GIZMO - waving his hands madly, pointing behind 
Chris. Suddenly, Chris sees Joy at the door.
*
CHRIS
31
Joy? 
(suddenly realizes)
JOOOOYYYYYY!!!
PROFILE ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHRIS AND JOY - As she spins him 
around by the shoulders.

 JOY
32
Chris Quantum, that’s cheating. You 
get caught nobody can help you.   
JOY OTS ON CHRIS - as she pokes him on the chest.
JOY (CONT’D)
33
Not me, not your parents. NOT EVEN 
THE TEACHER!!!
CHRIS
34
Look! I forgot to study. I wanna go 
*
to the amusement park, but I can’t 
*
unless I pass the test.
*
WIDE ANGLE INCLUDES JOY, CHRIS AND GIZMO - as Chris pulls the 
DC3000 out of his pocket and waves it at her.
*
Joy reaches for the DC3000. As they struggle over it, 
SUPERBOOK emerges from Chris’ backpack, <ZZT! ZING!> filling 
the air with energy.
JOY
35
*
As your friend... (struggling) 
*
CHRIS
36
*
Joy, quit it! (struggling)
*
CHRIS/JOY 
37
*
(Struggling)... I am not going to 
*
let you.
*
CHRIS/JOY (CONT’D)
38
*
SUPERBOOK! 
*
WIDE ANGLE - as the kids are pulled into SUPERBOOK’s vortex. 
STORYBOARD ARTIST - PLEASE REFERENCE EPISODE 106 “A GIANT 
ADVENTURE” and duplicate the shot by shot sequence as 
established in the pilot but tailor it for your setting, 
staging and BGs - Length and amount of shots in the sequence 
should be similar.
CHRIS
39
Hey! I wonder if time travel counts 
*
as an excuse? 
JOY
40
Very funny, Chris.
CHRIS, JOY, & GIZMO
41
*
WHOAAA!!
*
INT. SUPERBOOK VORTEX - CONTINUOUS

Chris, Joy and Gizmo tumble through space as...

 SUPERBOOK (V.O.)
42
I am taking you back in time to 
meet three men who chose to obey 
God, even in the face of great 
personal danger.
INT. MESHACH’S HOUSE (NEW SET)- ANCIENT BABYLON - DAY (PAST)
In a FLASH OF LIGHT the kids and Gizmo are dropped into a 
quiet room. It is simply a LARGE DINING AREA with a TABLE 
beneath a WINDOW. Just behind them is a DOORWAY to another 
room (the kitchen area.) 
CHRIS, JOY, & GIZMO
43
*
(impact grunts)
*
Joy holds up Chris’ phone triumphantly.
*
JOY
44
It’s all mine now, Chris. I win! 
*
(giggle)
*
CHRIS
45
*
Joy, you better give me my phone, 
*
I’m telling you, I need it -- huh?
*
Chris shrugs as we HEAR faint MUMBLES OF MEN (SHADRACH AND 
ABEDNEGO) ARGUING from the next room.
SHADRACH (O.S.)
46
*
(barely audible)
*
And I say you do have the courage. 
*
C’mon try to fight me!!!
*
ABEDNEGO (O.S.)
47
*
(also barely audible)
*
No, no, no. Would you let go of 
*
me!? 
*
GIZMO
48
*
It sounds like someone else is 
*
fighting, too. Now look what you 
*
two started!
*
ABEDNEGO (O.C.)
49
*
We’re not children.
*
As he turns towards the other room...
ANGLE ON DOORWAY TO KITCHEN
TWO LARGE MEN, SHADRACH (NEW MODEL), 36, a burly, bearded man 
and ABEDNEGO (NEW MODEL), 34, slightly smaller, shaven head 
also bearded CHARGE THROUGH the doorway. 
*

 Shadrach has Abednego in a headlock forcibly rushing him 
along and consequently right towards Chris and Giz.
SHADRACH AND ABEDNEGO
50
Aaaahh!!!!!
MATCHED ACTION - WIDE ANGLE ON KIDS
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
51
*
Whoa!/Aah!/Oh no!
*
Shadrach and Abednego crash into the kids, knocking them 
*
offscreen as they continue their path.
*
Giz’ CIRCUITS around his head SPARK a bit but a FIRE 
*
EXTINGUISHER appears from his chest cavity, SPRAYS, and puts 
*
them out. It retracts. 
GIZMO
52
*
(woozy-wobble) Uhhhh....
*
SHADRACH
53
(laughing)
You see, I was right, you are 
courageous.
ABEDNEGO
54
Yes, you make a good point even if 
it is hard on my head... 
*
Abednego suddenly notices something behind him.
OTS OF ABEDNEGO TO CHRIS AND GIZ - as he turns to them.
ABEDNEGO (CONT’D)
55
...and our guests?
WIDE ON DOORWAY FROM KITCHEN - as MESHACH (NEW MODEL), 33, 
clean shaven, less burly than the other two, enters the room. 
He has a soft-spoken calming manner about him.
MESHACH
56
We have guests?  
He turns and notices Joy next to him.
CLOSE ON JOY - as she grins, too, and waves with her fingers.
WIDER ON GROUP
MESHACH (CONT’D)
57
I am Meshach, this is Shadrach and 
*
this is Abednego.
JOY
58
(indicating each person)
I’m Joy. This is Chris, and Gizmo.

 GIZMO
59
*
We apologize for dropping in like 
*
this, but Superbook doesn’t always - 
*
Doh! 
*
He stops short as Joy elbows him in the chest.
*
JOY
60
*
(awkward giggle) So! Um, what were 
*
you guys fighting about?
*
CLOSE ON MESHACH
*
MESHACH
61
We weren’t fighting. 
*
TWO SHOT ABEDNEGO AND SHADRACH
*
ABEDNEGO 
62
We were ‘discussing’ how the king 
is wasting money on a statue. 
WIDE ON GROUP ABEDNEGO INDICATES TOWARDS THE WINDOW - The 
*
kids and Gizmo climb onto a bench by the wall and look out 
*
the window as Shadrach says...
*
SHADRACH
63
A statue to a false god. One he 
wants us to bow to... but we never 
*
will.
EXT. MESHACH’S HOUSE - NEAR WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
*
MATCHED SHOT - as the kids appear in the window and GASP in 
AWE! The music swells. 
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
64
*
(ad-lib gasps and low expressions 
*
of awe --- Wow/Incredible/Amazing 
*
structure/look at that)
*
OVER THEIR HEADS - THROUGH WINDOW - POV  We see the giant 
*
statue of BEL-MARDUK in the distance, out of the Plain of 
*
Dura. It is 90-FEET tall, made of PURE GOLD, and it GLISTENS 
*
in the SUN. 
*
EXT. HIGH ANGLE DOWN ON THE STATUE - CONTINUOUS
*
The CAMERA MOVES AROUND the statue in a helicopter-type shot.
*
BACK ON THE KIDS - We MOVE across their faces. 
*
CHRIS
65
Whoa, AWESOME!

 JOY
66
It’s amazing. And it looks like 
*
it’s made of gold.
*
NEW ANGLE - CLOSE ON ABEDNEGO
*
ABEDNEGO
67
Yes, Joy. It’s pure gold. But 
that’s all it is. Just metal.
CLOSE ON GIZMO - He knocks on his chest - clank clank! - and 
*
shoots a resentful glance at Abednego.
*
WIDE ON THE GROUP - as Chris, Joy and Giz, still on the 
*
bench, turn to listen.
MESHACH
68
Our God created everything. Even 
the gold in that statue.
ABEDNEGO
69
When we pray to him, He hears and 
answers our prayers because He is 
*
real.
CLOSE ON THE KIDS - captivated by their story
CHRIS
70
So if the statue’s not alive, 
what’s the harm in bowing to it?
ANGLE BACK ON THE MEN - Shadrach pushes between his friends.
SHADRACH
71
(defensive)
Because our God alone is worthy of 
worship. He commands we not bow to 
other gods.
Shadrach puts a calming hand on Meshach’s shoulder.
*
MESHACH
72
(calmer)
Yet if we do not bow, the king will 
*
only see it as direct disobedience 
*
to his authority... It is a 
*
difficult choice to make. 
*
*
NEW ANGLE ON THE KIDS LOOKING CONFUSED
*
CHRIS
73
*
But why? Just do what you wanna do.
*
ABEDNEGO
74
*
If we disobey the king, we will be 
*
thrown into a blazing furnace.

 ANGLE ON THE KIDS - Joy and Gizmo are scared. Chris rolls his *
eyes.
*
DISSOLVE TO: 
*
EXT. FURNACE - DAY 
*
CAMERA is facing the brick furnace. It’s two stories high 
*
about 15 x 20 (PLEASE RESEARCH ACCURATE REFERENCE ART AND 
*
ADJUST AS NECESSARY) - (Based on the reference map, camera is *
facing in a N.W. direction WITH THE PALACE O.C. BEHIND. There *
is a ten foot high wall that surrounds the furnace area and 
*
creates a half acre courtyard - which we don’t see from this 
*
angle. (For use later)  The wall is lined with large stone 
*
planters and greenery. (For use later) - CURRENTLY, LARGE IN 
*
FRAME are the open double doors of the furnace. A fire rages 
*
inside. FURNACE OPERATOR steps forward and tosses some wood 
*
into the flame. CAMERA rises up the two-story furnace, giving *
us a view - through the wavering lines of extreme heat - out 
*
to the Plain of Dura where we see the large gold statue in 
*
the distance. When the camera reaches its apex, it moves 
*
backwards at an angle - back - back - back and eventually 
*
makes it over the lip of a palace balcony - and it finally 
*
settles to a stop over the shoulder of King Nebuchadnezzar, 
*
who is looking out over his kingdom - in the direction of the *
giant statue. (His direct POV does not include the furnace 
*
unless he leans out and looks far to the left.)
*
60 NEBUCHADNEZZAR
75
*
Behold this glorious creation of 
*
mine!  How it watches over all of 
*
Babylon.
*
KING’S SOLDIER #1 approaches from the throne room behind. 
*
SOLDIER #1
76
My Lord.  The ceremony awaits. 
The king listens but doesn’t turn. 
NEBUCHADNEZZAR
77
Excellent. 
*
His eyes move to the right with a head shift as he looks in a *
N.E. Direction. (ERIN’S REF MAP OF BABYLON)
*
POV - Scores people move up the high walled PRECESSIONAL WAY, *
leading toward the ISHTAR GATE. (From this distance they are 
*
extremely small and ND - just a flood of people moving up the *
walled street.)
*
NEBUCHADNEZZAR (CONT’D)
78
*
Today, all will worship at the feet 
*
of my statue.

 EXT. PROCESSIONAL WAY LEADING TO ISHTAR GATE - DAY
*
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego walk with Joy. Chris and Gizmo 
are a short distance ahead the others.  They are just exiting *
out through the Ishtar gate. There are officials behind them 
*
and some passing by them. There are GOVERNORS, COUNSELORS, 
*
TREASURERS, JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES, ETC. (NO EVERYDAY 
*
CITIZENS)
*
CROWD
79
(LOW WALLA)
*
CLOSE ON GIZMO - ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GATE (PLEASE LIMIT 
*
CROWD BY CAREFUL CHOICE OF ANGLES - Shooting N.E. Will help 
*
because crowd that exits through the gate would move N.W. 
*
Toward the Plain of Dura) - He suddenly WHIRLS AROUND and 
*
becomes the quintessential TOURIST, complete with HAWAIIAN 
SHIRT and BERMUDA SHORTS. 
*
GIZMO
80
*
Oh, Chris! Who knew Babylon in 500 
*
BC could be so much fun!
*
He notices the gold statue in the distance and whirls back 
*
toward Chris and pronounces with a forefinger n the air. 
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
81
*
Profile pic! 
*
CHRIS zips right to him. They cock their heads and lean 
*
toward each other in a cheesy pose, leaving a space between 
*
their heads. In that space, we can see the giant statue in 
*
the distant BG. Size-wise, it appears to be about the size of *
their heads because of the perspective. Smiling, Gizmo whips 
*
his hand just under the “base” of the statue. Chris whips his *
hand just over the top of the statue. It appears they are 
*
holding the statue between themselves. Simultaneously, a 
*
futuristic point-and-shoot camera is whipping out of Gizmo’s 
*
chest on the support arm and snaps their pic. <FLASH> As the 
*
camera retracts, we hear <computerized SFX>. Gizmo pops open 
*
his wrist device and reads the screen as he beams with pride:
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
82
*
Tagged! Uploaded! And we’ve already 
*
received thirty-five “likes!”
*
CHRIS
83
*
Really? 
*
GIZMO
84
*
Uh, no, Chris. Are you nuts? It is 
*
500 BC!
*
NEW ANGLE TRACKING WITH JOY as she and Shadrach stop outside 
*
the arch. (Again - SHOOT THEM to avoid the crowds when 
*
possible - N.E. Perhaps would work best)

 JOY
85
So what’s going on today? It looks 
*
like a celebration.
*
CAMERA MOVES UP TO Shadrach’s face. 
*
SHADRACH
86
Yes, a celebration for everyone... 
*
but us.
NAMTAR (O.C.
87
*
Oh! There they are!
*
NAMTAR, a wiry official approaches the group. His BEARD 
*
merges with his face and hat to create the illusion of a 
point. Next to him is APSU, 49, a slightly smaller man who 
*
has the constant look as if he’s just eaten a sour lemon.  He 
wears a ROBE and always keeps his arms folded in the sleeves. 
He never speaks aloud.  They have both stopped very close to 
*
the ISHTAR GATE.  This will keep the structure wall as a BG 
*
and eliminate needing to see the crowd still passing.  There 
*
is a flaming torch on the wall within reach.  Also with 
*
Namtar and Apsu is KING’S SOLDIER #2. Namtar waves his FINGER 
in Shadrach’s face as Abednego and Meshach move beside him.
*
NAMTAR (CONT’D)
88
*
I should have reported your 
*
insolence long ago!
PAUSE - Apsu whispers in Namtar's ear feeding his thoughts. 
*
APSU
89
*
(whispering)
*
NAMTAR
90
You do not value your high 
*
positions.
APSU
91
*
(whispering)
*
NAMTAR
92
*
You secretly disregard the throne. 
*
APSU
93
*
(Whispering)
*
NAMTAR
94
*
And you’re standing on my foot.
(suddenly realizing and 
*
breaking character)
*
Oh, I am? I’m sorry, Apsu.
Namtar jumps to get off Apsu’s foot.  He is closer to the 
*
torch on the wall. He notes it and then whips back to 
*
Shadrach.

95
*
I know what this ceremony means for  
*
you... your god.  Now, we say, you 
*
bow to the king’s statue... 
*
Without turning to look behind him, he reaches up and plucks 
*
a piece of the burning ember off the burning torch core.  
*
Showing his toughness - holding the flaming ember in his bare *
fingers - he slowly presents it forward towards MS&A’s faces.
*
NAMTAR (CONT’D)
96
*
... or else!
*
EXTREME CLOSE ON SHADRACH AND NAMTAR with the flaming ember

held in Namtar’s fingers between them.  Shadrach’s eyes move 
*
from Namtar’s face down to the burning ember, then back to 
*
Namtar’s face.  Then Namtar - starting to feel the heat - his *
expression weakens - and his eyes look form Shadrach’s face 
*
down to the burning ember.  Then back up... a beat --- tough - *
narrowing eyes --- his fingers begin to smoke outward. 
*
Finally, he freaks.
*
NAMTAR (CONT’D)
97
*
Oh...Owowowowowowow!

He whips his fingers around and douses out the flame. Chris

steps forward.

CHRIS

Oh, you’re just trying to scare

them with empty threats.

NAMTAR

Empty threats?!

ON NAMTAR - as he pulls back and raises his hand. Apsu 
*
whispers to him. 
*
NAMTAR (CONT’D)
100
*
Soldier! Tell the king, Namtar 
*
reports the ceremony is ready to 
proceed.
He shakes his singed fingers again. The soldier nods and 
*
walks away followed by Namtar and Apsu. TRACKING NAMTAR AND 
*
APSU - Apsu whispers something in the Namtar’s ear. 
*
APSU

Namtar turns back and calls out, throwing a defiant - singed-

smoking - forefinger in the air, on the move...

They have a tough decision to make,

sinister grin.

CHRIS

What you guys did out there

today... you know, not bowing like

that? I mean...  you’re gonna lose

your jobs with the king, right?

MESHACH
138

I am certain the king is deciding

our fate at this very moment.

CHRIS
139

But you’re good with that, right? I 
*
mean, what? You might get a 
*
demotion? But there’s probably... 
*
you know... hundreds of other jobs 
*
in the kingdom for guys like you.  
*
What do you got around here, like 
*
torch lighters... brick layers... 
*
who cleans up after your big statue

ceremonies and stuff - right?

They don’t respond.

Yeah... you’ll land on your feet,

No.

Chris, ever so casually saunters around behind Joy as he

speaks ---

CHRIS

Right! Because soldiers aren’t

coming to arrest them and that

furnace doesn’t exist.  There is

EXT. PLAIN OF DURA - AREA BENEATH STATUE - NIGHT

WE MOVE DOWN from the statue’s face. IT is lit from below by 
TORCHES, looking more like an entity standing in eternal 
flames now than something to be worshiped. DOWN WE GO TO:
A WIDE SHOT OF ARREST SCENE - as Shadrach, Meshach and 
Abednego are shoved in front of Nebuchadnezzar who stands 
with SOLDIERS #1, #2, #3, #4, Namtar and Apsu.

have set up. (NLT)

a tree that grows near the wall and the branches spread over

the top of the wall (To be used later) We now see a group of

8 GUARDS/SOLDIERS standing behind MS&A.  The King, Namtar and *
Apsu and the King’s Official (character who announced at the

 SCRIPTURE REFERENCE NKJV
*
Daniel 3
*
The Image of Gold
*
 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose 
*
height was sixty cubits and its width six cubits. He set it 
*
up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 2 And 
*
King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps, *
the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the 
*
treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the 
*
officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the 
*
image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 3 So the satraps, *
the administrators, the governors, the counselors, the 
*
treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the 
*
officials of the provinces gathered together for the 
*
dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up; 
*
and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set 
*
up. 4 Then a herald cried aloud: “To you it is commanded, O 
*
peoples, nations, and languages, 5 that at the time you hear 
*
the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in 
*
symphony with all kinds of music, you shall fall down and 
*
worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; 6 *
and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast 
*
immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.”
*
7 So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the *
horn, flute, harp, and lyre, in symphony with all kinds of 
*
music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and 
*
worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set 
*
up.
*
Daniel’s Friends Disobey the King
*
   
*
8 Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and 
*
accused the Jews. 9 They spoke and said to King 
*
Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever! 10 You, O king, have 
*
made a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, 
*
flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds 
*
of music, shall fall down and worship the gold image; 11 and 
*
whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the *
midst of a burning fiery furnace. 12 There are certain Jews 
*
whom you have set over the affairs of the province of 
*
Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, *
have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods 
*
or worship the gold image which you have set up.”
*
13 Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury, gave the command to *
bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. So they brought these *
men before the king. 14 Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them, *
“Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do 
*
not serve my gods or worship the gold image which I have set 
*
up? 
*

 15 Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the *
horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery, in symphony with all 
*
kinds of music, and you fall down and worship the image which *
I have made, good! But if you do not worship, you shall be 
*
cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
*
And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?”
*
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the 
*
king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in 
*
this matter. 17 If that is the case, our God whom we serve is *
able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He 
*
will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18 But if not, let it *
be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor 
*
will we worship the gold image which you have set up.”
*
Saved in Fiery Trial
*
   
*
19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the expression 
*
on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. 
*
He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times *
more than it was usually heated. 20 And he commanded certain 
*
mighty men of valor who were in his army to bind Shadrach, 
*
Meshach, and Abed-Nego, and cast them into the burning fiery 
*
furnace. 21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their 
*
trousers, their turbans, and their other garments, and were 
*
cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 22 
*
Therefore, because the king’s command was urgent, and the 
*
furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those 
*
men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. 23 And 
*
these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell down 
*
bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
*
24 Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished; and he rose in 
*
haste and spoke, saying to his counselors, “Did we not cast 
*
three men bound into the midst of the fire?”
*
They answered and said to the king, “True, O king.”
*
25 “Look!” he answered, “I see four men loose, walking in the *
midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the *
fourth is like the Son of God.”[a]
*
Nebuchadnezzar Praises God
*
   
*
26 Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning 
*
fiery furnace and spoke, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- *
Nego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come 
*
here.” Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the 
*
midst of the fire. 27 And the satraps, administrators, 
*
governors, and the king’s counselors gathered together, and 
*
they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power; the *
hair of their head was not singed nor were their garments 
*
affected, and the smell of fire was not on them.
*

 28 Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying, “Blessed be the God of 
*
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent His Angel[b] and 
*
delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and they have 
*
frustrated the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that 
*
they should not serve nor worship any god except their own 
*
God! 29 Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or *
language which speaks anything amiss against the God of 
*
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego shall be cut in pieces, and 
*
their houses shall be made an ash heap; because there is no 
*
other God who can deliver like this.”
*
30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego in *
the province of Babylon.
