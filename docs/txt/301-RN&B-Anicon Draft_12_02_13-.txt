TAKE AWAY: Be loyal and kind in your relationships.
SYNOPSIS:
Chris is having a conflict over going to lake with Joy's family 
for some fun in  the sun, or staying home and helping his ditzy 
Great Aunt Isobel with some summer chores around her house.  When 
Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Ruth, Naomi and Boaz, Chris 
slowly comes to newfound respect for the effort, time, and care it 
takes to attend to relationships - especially with ones family.  
He sees the kind of dedication Ruth had for Naomi, traveling with 
her, living with her and supporting her after her husband died.  
In the end, Ruth marries Boaz and Chris realizes she never would 
have found this happiness if she had ignored her relationship with 
Naomi.  Chris returns home and foregoes the lake trip to spend 
time with Aunt Isobel and  learns to be kind and loyal and kind in 
his relationships with family.

FADE IN:
EXT. BOAZ’ BARLEY FIELDS IN BETHLEHEM - DAY
WIDE ESTABLISHING SHOT workers during harvest.  These should 
be some impressive shots, with motions and sound of the field 
matching the rhythm of the music. THE SHOTS MIGHT INCLUDE:
LOW UP ANGLE TRACKING SHOT PASSING - WORKER #1, WORKER #2 AND 
WORKER #3 cutting grain with sickles.
CONTINUE PASSING - WORKER #4, WORKER #5, WORKER #6 tying the 
stalks into sheaves.

threshing floor, with loose grains flying underneath.
EXT. BOAZ’ BARLEY FIELD AGAIN - CONTINUOUS
FIND WORKER #7, WORKER #8 pouring grain while WORKER #9 and 
WORKER #10 wave winnowing fans. 
CLOSE ON BOAZ
*
He comes a around a cart filled with grain and inspects the 
*
barley.  He looks up and greets his workers.
*
BOAZ (O.C.)
The Lord be with you! (Ruth 2:4 
NKJV)
Everyone stops working and looks...
 WORKER 
The Lord be with you.  
*
WORKERS
May the he Lord bless you! (Ruth 
*
2:4 NKJV)
Boaz walks through the field with his head servant, NATAN, as 
the threshers go back to work.
BOAZ
It seems that Israel’s famine has 
finally ended, Natan.
NATAN
Not everyone has recovered, Boaz.  
Many people have come to glean from 
us this year.
BOAZ POV
THE OUTER EDGE OF FIELD. A group of 6 GLEANERS - (5 Women and 
1 man) are picking up the few leftover stalks of grain in the 
harvested corner. 
BOAZ (O.C.)
God has blessed us with more barley 
than we need. Should we not share 
that blessing with our neighbors?
BACK ON BOAZ & NATAN
Boaz’s attention is drawn to a nearby gleanaer (RUTH) 
NATAN
Yes.  And the wheat is nearly ripe. 
*
We’ll be harvesting that soon as 
*
well.  
*
CAMERA MOVES TO BOAZ’ POV AND FINDS RUTH - beautiful, but 
plainly dressed. She is working hard, struggling to tie the 
grain into a bundle. Determined.
BACK ON BOAZ
Boaz points and Natan turns to look as...
BOAZ
       (Ruth 2:5 NLT)
Natan, who is that young woman over 
there? 
MEDIUM SHOT ON RUTH
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         2.
 NATAN (O.C._)
        (Ruth 2:6 ESV) 
Ah, She is the young Moabite woman 
*
who came back with Naomi. I think 
her name is Ruth.
ON NATAN and BOAZ
BOAZ 
      (Ruth 3:15-16 NLT)
So that is Ruth. --  Natan, let her 
gather grain among the sheaves. 
Pull out some heads of barley from 
the bundles and drop them on 
purpose for her. (Ruth 2:9 CEV)
And make sure the men don’t bother 
her. 
NATAN
But... there are dozens of gleaners 
out there.  What is so special 
about this one? 
CLOSE ON BOAZ 
still watching the field. 
BOAZ
Do as I asked. And don't give her a 
hard time. (Ruth 2:16 NLT) Her life 
has been difficult enough.
BOAZ starts to walk away from Natan. Natan turns and looks at 
Ruth.
ON RUTH 
CAMERA PUSHES IN - she finally looks up, revealing her whole 
face.  Beautiful.
FADE OUT.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. QUANTUM HOUSE - DAY
We PUSH DOWN through the glass roof into Chris’ bedroom where 
we see him packing a suitcase.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         3.
 CHRIS
Let’ see.  Snorkel, check.  Suntan 
lotion, check.  Clean socks.  At 
least two pairs.  Double check.
ON CHRiS
He holds up two pairs of swim trunks.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
It’s supposed to be hot at the lake 
this weekend so, green or blue? 
Nya... maybe both.
He flips them into the suitcase.
ANGLE ON GIZMO
Gizmo is shoveling ice from a big bag on the floor into his 
open chest.  <KNOCKING SOUND> at the door. 
GIZMO
Yaaa!!!!
He freaks and careens towards the closet.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
It’s your great aunt!  Whoa!
He bangs into Chris and they both fall into the open closet.
CHRIS (O.C.)
Oww... Gizmo you’re going to bend 
the suitcase (muffled walla) 
ON JOY
Joy looks in the closet puzzled by the comotion. 
JOY 
Wow.  Calm down.  It's just me! 
She enters leaving the door open.
*
GIZMO
We thought you might be Chris’s 
Aunt Isobel.
JOY 
That lady downstairs? 
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         4.
 CHRIS  
Yeah.  Trust me.  She’s just plain 
wacky. 
He stands there with a baseball glove on his head.  Joy gives 
him a look as if to say “Who’s wacky?”
FAVOR GIZMO
Gizmo opens his “front door” adding ice to his seemingly 
infinite storage area.
GIZMO 
Yes!  She thinks I am a 
refrigerator.
Joy leans INTO FRAME watching him put the inside.  
JOY 
(sarcastically) 
Yeah - that is crazy.
Gizmo indignantly <SLAMS> his door shut. As he starts 
talking, colored bottles of juice pop up out of the top of 
his head.  
GIZMO 
I happen to be working on a way to 
keep you cool when we go to the 
lake this weekend.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
<DING SFX>  His chest plate opens.  Frozen vapors waft out. 
The extension “arm” whips out holding a bright rainbow-
colored snow cone (something more remarkable than a normal 
snow cone - maybe with sprinkles and a cherry) and hands it 
to Joy. 
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Try a Gizmolicious Glacier Cone, 
available in 73 different flavors.
And wait ‘til you see what I can do 
at high speed.
His hatch <SLAMS SHUT> and the <ICE CRUNCHING> begins LOUDER 
than before and his body quakes from the higher speed.   
Suddenly, his hatch flies open. A blizzard of ice shoots out 
of him.  Propelled by the force of all the ice, Gizmo flies 
backwards towards the door.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Whoooooooaaaaaa!
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         5.
 JOY
GIZMO!
Chris and Joy chase after Gizmo.
GIZMO
(scream)
CHRIS
The stairs!  Watch out for the 
stairs!
INT. QUANTUM STAIRS CASE - CONTINUOUS
Gizmo is flying down the stairs, tumbling and turning amid 
the avalanche of ice flying out of his chest.
GIZMO
(whoas/screams and falling sounds)
INT. QUANTUM FOYER - CONTINUOUS
PHOEBE stands with an eccentric-looking older woman, AUNT 
ISOBEL.  They are about to head out the door, when they whirl 
at the commotion then leap apart and O.C.
PHOEBE
*
Gizmo!
AUNT ISOBEL
Oh my!
*
Gizmo bounces THROUGH FRAME - smashes into the front door - 
and then bounces straight into Aunt Isobel.
GIZMO
(bouncing and hitting efforts)
PROFILE TWO-SHOT of GIZMO & AUNT ISOBEL, hanging on to each 
other out of sheer panic. Face to face as they spin.
AUNT ISOBEL 
*
Aaaaaaahhhh!
GIZMO
Aaaahhhhh! GIZMOOO!
AUNT ISOBEL
Oh... oh... OHHHH! (into impact 
against the door)
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         6.
 WIDER ANGLE 
Chris and Joy grab Gizmo.  Aunt Isobel is helped up by 
Phoebe.  
AUNT ISOBEL (CONT’D)
Christopher! Your refrigerator is 
after me again! 
A few loose ice cubes rattle out of Gizmo’s “ears.” <SOUND FX 
GIZMO RATTLING NOISE, THEN ICE CUBES FALLING>  
GIZMO
I am not a refrigerator!
One of the juice bottle bursts.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Yaa!!
The juice bottle dispenser spins.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.....
Chris turns to Aunt Isobel as Gizmo runs out of steam.
CHRIS 
Sorry, Aunt Isobel. It was an 
accident. Gizmo won't hurt you.
Aunt Isobel turns and looks at Chris.
AUNT ISOBEL
Awww....
She crosses and grabs Chris in a suffocating hug/kiss.
AUNT ISOBEL (CONT’D)
Come here, you!  (loud extended 
kissing sound)
She leaves a giant red lipstick mark on Chris’ forehead. 
AUNT ISOBEL (CONT’D)
Fine.  I'll see you this weekend, 
Christopher.  
CHRIS
Huh?
Aunt Isobel exits.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         7.
 AUNT ISOBEL
And leave the ice maker at home.
*
Phoebe shuts the front door.   Chris swipes at the lipstick 
on his face and turns to Phoebe. 
CHRIS
Mom? What did she mean by that?
WIDER to INCLUDE PHOEBE
PHOEBE 
Well, you aunt needs some painting 
and yard work done.  And she needs 
a strong boy like you to help. 
CHRIS 
Mom, I'm going to the lake with 
Joy’s family.
CLOSE ON PHOEBE
PHOEBE 
That was this weekend? Oh Chris, 
I’m sorry, I forgot--
TWO SHOT
Chris throws his hands up in exasperation.
CHRIS
MOM! She thinks I'm coming to her 
house!  Can't you and dad help her? 
Chris buries his face in his hands.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
(low)
No... no.. Noo..noo...
PHOEBE
I’m sorry, Chris. I really did get 
my dates mixed up. We won't make 
you go. 
Chris peers out between his fingers on surprise.
CHRIS
Huh?
PHOEBE
The choice is up to you.
Phoebe turns and exits to the kitchen. 
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         8.
 ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
Chris glowers defiantly, arms crossed.
CHRIS
There is no way I'm going to spend 
the weekend doing hard labor for my 
great aunt!
Suddenly, the Superbook FX appear. <SUPERBOOK FX>
CHRIS & JOY 
Superbook!
Superbook passes then and lands, getting ready to open.
GIZMO
And I wasted half a day crushing 
ice for your snow cones!! 
The trio gets pulled into the book.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
(whoas / Here we go!)
CUT TO:
INT. SUPERBOOK TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
The kids fly along.
SUPERBOOK VO 
I am taking you to meet a woman who 
gave up everything to show kindness 
to her family.
WIPE TO:
EXT. BOAZ’ BARLEY FIELD - DAY
The trio shimmers into a corner of Boaz’s barley field, 
behind an olive tree.  There is a SHELTER twenty yards away 
with its opening facing the direction of the tree, so someone 
could see into the shelter from the tree. (For use later) 
They look around. There are workers passing with Barley.  
Natan stands about ten yards away, watching the field 
workers, not noticing the kids.
CHRIS
Quick!  Hide!   
The kids duck behind a bush.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         9.
 CHRIS (CONT’D)
Giz, get a reading on where we are 
this time?
GIZMO 
(hushed)
According to my geo-sensors, we 
have arrived just outside Bethlehem 
in the 12th century BC.
<A HORSE APPROACH> They quickly duck behind the tree.
BOAZ (O.C.)
Natan...
ON NATAN
He turns as Boaz approaches on his horse. (Just walking not 
charging up.)
BOAZ (CONT’D)
I am looking for the Moabite woman, 
Ruth. She’s no longer with the 
other gleaners.
NATAN 
I will ask about her.
The men exit in opposite directions.
CLOSE ON THE KIDS AT THE TREE
JOY
Giz. What are these “gleaners” he’s 
talking about?
GIZMO
My info-scan files indicate 
“gleaners” are poor people who 
collect leftover crops from a 
farmer's field once the harvesters 
have finished. 
CHRIS
“Collect?”  Sounds kind’a like 
stealing to me.
CLOSE ON JOY
looking around the field. 
JOY
Chris - not so loud. 
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         10.
 POV
Three Female gleaners work nearby. 
BACK ON THE KIDS
Chris looks off at the countryside.
CHRIS (O.C.)
Yeah, well, I say we find somewhere 
else to go real quick.  Because 
it’s summer break and I don’t want 
to spend it pulling weeds and 
whatever with these poor people.  
ANGLE SLOWLY SHIFTS to reveal Ruth approaching behind him, 
carrying a basket, listening to him with amusement. Joy and 
Gizmo, watching Ruth, and try to motion to Chris to be quiet. 
JOY 
Chri-is.
RUTH
(gentle laugh)
Chris whips around, embarrassed. 
CHRIS
Uh--I - uh wasn’t - that is,  I 
didn’t mean--
CLOSE ON RUTH
RUTH 
We are poor. But we are all working 
hard to feed our families. 
Ruth motions for them to follow her into the field.
RUTH (CONT’D)
I am Ruth. Come, you may glean with 
us.
Joy walks with Ruth. 
CAMERA MOVES CLOSE on Gizmo and Chris, who lag behind, 
whispering
                      GIZMO 
Ruth?  She is the one the boss is 
looking for!
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         11.
 CHRIS 
Huh? See, I told you.  He’s 
*
definitely going to be mad at her 
*
for stealing his grain.  You wait 
and see.
FAVOR RUTH
She starts to pick up loose stalks of grain on the ground. 
Joy follows her lead.
JOY
*
Why do you have to do this?
*
RUTH
Naomi.
*
JOY
Who is Naomi?
She looks away - thoughtfully.
FLASHBACK:
EXT. ROAD IN MOAB - DAY (Flashback)
WIDE HIGH ANGLE ON NAOMI’S TWO SONS WALKING WITH RUTH AND 
ORPAH.  
RUTH (O.C.)
Naomi had two sons. I married on 
and Orpah married the other... then 
both sons died.
The TWO SONS disappear from the scene as Ruth and Orpah 
continue to walk - now alone.
RUTH (CONT’D)
So, Naomi, whose own husband had 
died years before, had no one to 
look after her.
They walk INTO CAMERA creating the WIPE TO:
FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD
Ruth and Orpah now walk with NAOMI.
RUTH (CONT’D)
She decided to return to her 
family’s home in Bethlehem.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         12.
 CLOSER ANGLE
The women stop.  We see Naomi’s sad face and a tear rolling 
down her cheek. 
RUTH (V.O.)
My sister-in-law and I wanted to 
come with her, but she stopped us.
CLOSE ON NAOMI, RUTH AND ORPAH
NAOMI 
(in flashback) Don't you want to go 
back home to your own mothers?  May 
the Lord give each of you another 
husband and a home of your own. 
(Ruth 1:8-9 CEV)
RUTH(VO) 
My sister-in-law went back home…
CLOSE ON NAOMI AND ORPHAH, crying, kissing each other on the 
cheek, and hugging. 
WIDE, HIGH ANGLE OF ROAD. Orpah turns and goes back down the 
road in the opposite direction of Naomi.
RUTH (VO) (CONT’D)
…but I stayed with Naomi.
CLOSE ON RUTH, clinging to Naomi.
RUTH (CONT’D)
(in flashback) Wherever you go, I 
will go. Wherever you live, I will 
live. Your people will be my 
people, and your God will be my 
God. (Ruth 1:16 NLT)

down the road as we dissolve out of the flashback.
EXT. BOAZ’ BARLEY FIELD - CONTINUOUS - (BACK TO REAL TIME)
Chris and Gizmo have been listening behind Ruth and are 
caught up in the story.
RUTH
When I married Naomi's son, she 
became my family. And where she 
goes, I go.  
ON JOY AND CHRIS
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         13.
 She turns to him.
JOY
Yeah.  Families take care of one 
another.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
Ruth’s words hit Chris.  A beat - Gizmo leans in towards him, 
pointing O.C.
GIZMO 
   (whispering loudly to Chris) 
Uh-oh -- it looks like the boss has 
found Ruth!
POV
Boaz is approaching on his horse.
BACK ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
CHRIS 
He’s going to think we’re helping 
her steal his barley!
ON BOAZ 
He rides up next to Ruth.  She lowers her head slightly out 
of respect.
RUTH
My lord.
BOAZ 
*
When you gather grain; don't go to 
any other fields. 
Boaz points to the other women in the field.
BOAZ (CONT’D)
Stay right behind the young women 
working in my field. And when you 
are thirsty, help yourself to the 
water they have drawn from the 
well. 
Boaz is getting off the horse, standing in front of Ruth. 
(RUTH 2: 9-14 NLT/CEV)  Ruth kneels at his feet.
RUTH 
What have I done to deserve such 
kindness? I am only a foreigner. 
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         14.
 CLOSE ON BOAZ
BOAZ
Yes, I know.  But I also know about 
everything you have done for your 
mother-in-law since the death of 
your husband. 
CLOSE ON RUTH
She slowly looks up at him reacting to his kindness.
BOAZ (O.C.  (CONT’D)
I have heard how you left your 
father and mother to live here 
among complete strangers. 
Boaz reaches INTO FRAME. She takes his hand and he pulls her 
to her feet so she is eye to eye with him.
BOAZ (CONT’D)
         (Ruth 2:12 CEV)
I pray that the Lord God of Israel 
will reward you for what you have 
done. 
RUTH 
You have comforted me by speaking 
so kindly. 
Boaz motions in the direction of the shelter.  Some of the 
workers (Not the Gleaners) are milling about the Shelter.
BOAZ 
It is lunchtime. Come and help 
yourself to some food. 
She stares after him for a moment as he departs.  Chris Joy 
and Gizmo step INTO FRAME.  Joy gives Chris a smile.

named Boaz. (Ruth 2:19 NLT)
Naomi turns to Ruth in surprise.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         15.
 NAOMI 
Boaz?  He’s one of my family’s 
*
relatives. (paraphrase Ruth 2:20 
*
NLT)
FAVOR JOY NEAR CHRIS AND GIZMO
JOY 
He took care of us all day. And he 
was good and kind and generous--
Chris cuts her off by stepping towards the basket.
CHRIS 
Generous? If he was generous, we'd 
be bringing home real food, instead 
of just ingredients.
Naomi reaches in and scoops a bowl of grain (unseen below the 
basket edge) from the basket.  
RUTH
Boaz did tell me to come back and 
*
stay in his field until the entire 
harvest is completed. (Ruth 2: 21 
NLT) 
*
NAOMI 
Good! Do as he said, my daughter. 
You'll be safe with him. (Ruth 2:22 
NLT)
She lifts the filled bowl out and takes it to another table 
closer to where Chris is. 
NAOMI (CONT’D)
God has a plan for Ruth’s future.

 CHRIS 
Aww... It's too hot out here to be 
working this hard! 
WIDEN TO INCLUDE
Gizmo, Joy and Ruth sitting on the ground below tying grain 
into sheaves. 
JOY 
All that hot air coming out of your 
mouth isn't helping.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
GIZMO 
Perhaps you would like to cool off 
with one of my famous Gizmolicious 
Glacier cones.
Gizmo gets ready to produce a snow cone when...  
WORKER 2 (O.C.)
You there!  
All turn to look.
CLOSE ON CHRIS, looking down at Worker #2 and #3 approaching, 
looking up at him.
WORKER 2 (CONT’D)
What are you doing here with the 
women?  Come down here!
CLOSE ON WORKER 2 as he pulls the tree branch down, and lets 
it snap back up, causing Chris to fall.
CHRIS 
(whoaaa... impact grunt)
WORKER 2 AND WORKER 3 Chris under his arms. They throw him up 
and down slightly, as if testing his weight.
WORKER 3 
He’s the right size.  Let’s go.
CHRIS 
The right size for what? Hey, put 
me down!
They carry Chris off as he squirms.  PUSH IN ON JOY.
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         17.
 JOY 
(giggle) - With those two in 
charge, he might finally get some 
work done.  
Gizmo runs off after Chris.
GIZMO
I will keep an eye on him.
ANGLE ON RUTH
Joy turns to her and takes a bundle of barley she holds.
RUTH
Thank you for all your help, Joy.
JOY
You’re welcome.  You and Naomi have 
been so kind letting us stay with 
you.  Helping glean is the least we 
can do in return.

rise in the BG.
CLOSER ON JOY
She gets to the top and looks O.C. With indignation, throwing 
down her barley.
JOY
What?!
WIDER ANGLE - THRESHING AREA
Joy approaches the threshing area where Gizmo walks along 
behind a sledge being pulled by an ox.  Chris lounges 
casually ON the sledge.
CHRIS
I’ll have another glacier cone 
please.
Gizmo hand it to him.
GIZMO
Here you go!
  SB 'RN&B" - Zimmerman - Anicon Draft 12-02-13         18.
 CHRIS
Ah, thank you.
The sledge stop suddenly and Chris is jerked forward so the 
*
glacier cone smack him in the face. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
(grunt) Hey!
Joy marches INTO FRAME, yanks the harness on the mule, and 
Chris stops with a jerk.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Hey! 
JOY  
This is what you've been doing all 
this time?  Taking joy rides on 
this - this- 
Gizmo zips in beside her - forefinger in the air.
GIZMO
 --Sledge. 
As Gizmo talks, we go close on his visor, which displays a 3D 
image of the sledge.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
It is an ancient harvesting tool 
used to separate the grain from the 
husk.
CLOSE ON CHRIS
CHRIS  
Lighten up, Joy. I'm just doing 
what they told me to do. (points 
his thumb toward THRESHER 1 AND 
THRESHER 2) 
Joy steps in front of Chris.
JOY
What you’re not doing is helping!
Gizmo zips up trying to lighten the mood.
GIZMO
Hey, Joy, I know!

 How would you like a...
(noting her scowl and 
going weak)
... Gizmolicious Glacier Cone. 
(Weak chuckle)
Joy turns back to Chris and leans in.
JOY
You don’t even see it, do you, 
Chris?
CHIS
See what?
JOY
How hard Ruth works... how 
committed she is to her family.  
She gave up everything when she 
came here so Naomi wouldn’t be 
alone.  They’re being kind to us 
and you won’t even help in the 
smallest way.
CHRIS
Joy...
JOY
It’s just like with your Aunt 
Isobel!  It’s always Chris Quantum 
first!
Chris gets distracted by his cone and makes sure it isn’t 
dripping.
JOY (CONT’D)
Ughhh!  You are so selfish 
sometimes!
She grabs the cone and drops it on Chris’ head and storms 
off.
CHRIS
Uh... heeey! (GRUNT)
He leaps up and shakes off the cone.
CHIS
Gizmo, am I selfish?
GIZMO
We offered her a glacier cone.
Gizmo holds up a cone.  Chris grabs it.

Ruth notices Boaz watching before he rides away.
Ruth brings baskets of barley home for Naomi.  Joy and Gizmo 
carry even more.  
Chris follows behind, not carrying any baskets.  
When everyone hugs and seems thankful for all the barley 
Chris is left out.
Boaz goes to the tree where Ruth left sheaves of barley.  He 
turns and sees her approaching with her arms full.  As she 
gets closer, she trips slightly. She drops the sheaves and 
Boaz catches her by the hand to keep her from falling.  They 
both look into one another’s eyes and then Ruth demurely 
retreats - pulling her hands away - and bends to pick up the 
barley.  Boaz assists her.  PUSH IN ON BOAZ as Ruth turns and 
exits with the barley.  He looks down at his hands - the 
hands she touched.  He turns and exits.  CAMERA MOVES TO 
NAOMI who has witnessed this interaction from the shadows.

Yup, and it appears I’ve found the

sleepily.

anything, but the glow of oil lamp suddenly reveals Ruth’s

both illuminated by the soft lamp light.

to marry a woman, he covers her 
with his cloak to claim her as his 
bride.

Wow.  That wasn’t what I expected 
to happen.  What about you, Chris?
CHRIS
Oh... ah... well, Boaz is following 
the customs... and if Ruth’s other 
relative will take care of her, 
then...

this season.) He turns his face toward the camera, and once 
we've gotten a glimpse of him, we go to black.
