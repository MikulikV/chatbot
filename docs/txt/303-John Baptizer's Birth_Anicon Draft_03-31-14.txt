Animatic Conformed Draft - 03-31-14
TAKE-AWAY: With God everything is possible.
SYNOPSIS: Chris, Joy and Gizmo are helping Phoebe baby sit for a 
neighbor so the friend can go Christmas shopping, but Joy seems to 
be getting the brunt of young Charlie's rambunctious nature.  She 
says it isn't that she doesn't like little kids, but she is NOT 
going to take care of Charlie on her own - not now - not ever.  
Suddenly, Superbook whisks the kids AND Charlie back in time.  
While Joy continues to contend with Charlie's playful but 
troublesome nature, during their biblical adventure, she also 
meets Elizabeth and Zechariah, who, though older, are about to 
have their first child.  As the story unwinds, and it slowly 
becomes apparent to Chris, Joy and Gizmo who Zechariah and 
Elizabeth's child is going to be, they are awed by what God has 
made possible.  While spending time with Elizabeth and her cousin, 
Mary, who has also with child, Joy absorbs some child rearing 
habits and learns to treat Charlie with peace and love - and he 
responds!  After John the Baptizer is born to Elizabeth and 
Zechariah, our kids return home and Joy has a whole new 
perspective on little Charlie.  She admits she's changed and hugs 
little Charlie, admitting, "With God, anything is possible.  And 
who know what great things Charlie might be headed for someday."

                         ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. Zechariah’S HILLSIDE VILLAGE (EIN-KEREM) - EARLY MORNING 
(6:00 A.M. CUSP OF SUNRISE)
The sun is casting an early dawn glow across the front of 
Zechariah’s house. SLOW PUSH IN as a family passes and two 
children laugh as they scamper along. 
CHILDREN
1
(playful laughter)
As the CAMERA PUSHES to the house we hear...
 
INT. ZECHARIAH’S HOUSE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Zechariah (in his civilian garb) and his wife, ELIZABETH, 
step out. They are lit by the rising sun and the subdued, 
warm, yellows from unseen oil lamps.   Elizabeth holds a 
small sack, large enough to contain bread, perhaps a wine 
skin, or some other food for traveling. Zechariah has a 
walking staff. 
ELIZABETH (O.C.)
2
You should go now, Zechariah.  The 
road to Jerusalem is long and the 
day will be hot. 
He turns to Elizabeth and we PUSH INTO A CLOSER TWO-SHOT. 
ZECHARIAH
3
Just a day’s journey, Elizabeth, 
but not a burdensome one. 
(MORE)
 You know how I look forward to my 
week of service at the Temple.   
EXT. ZECHARIAH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Zechariah opens the door and steps out - noticing children 
playing hide and seek with their mother.  
POV ON MOM AND CHILDREN
The children drop behind a rock. The mother pretends she 
can’t find them. The children then pop up. 
CHILDREN
4
(laughter) Here we are!
BACK ON ZECHARIAH
His look softens.  Elizabeth notes this.
ELIZABETH
5
What is it?
ZECHARIAH
6
I often think about our years 
together, Elizabeth, and how God 
has provided us with so many good 
things.  
(he pauses and looks away 
wistfully) )
Yet, the one thing He has never 
given...    
Elizabeth reaches up and places her free hand, lovingly, on 
her husband’s lips. It stops his speech. She answers softly 
and with a wistful smile.
ELIZABETH
7
I know, Zechariah.  
REVERSE ON ELIZABETH
ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
8
But if God had wanted us to have 
children, we would have had them.  
Now go.  We all serve God in 
different ways.
He kisses Elizabeth and exits.  Elizabeth turns and watches 
the children play with their mother.  We see she wishes the 
thing as her husband. TEMPLE TRANSITION MUSIC COMES UP.

 EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT THE TEMPLE AND CITY OF JERUSALEM - 
LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
We HEAR the VOICE of the OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES. 
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES (O.C.)
9
Newcomers only!  Whoever has never 
once offered the incense, let him 
come and draw lots!
                               
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THE CHAMBER OF HEWN STONE - LATE AFTERNOON  (CAMERA WILL 
WORK AROUND THIS ROOM IN THE FOLLOWING ACTION SO WE’LL NEED 
TO SEE ALL ANGLES)
(3rd Lottery is taking place) - Zechariah stands in circle 
with 11 priests.  Priest #1 is to his right.  (Reference 
image from the Temple Institute materials Erin provided shows 
a sort of loose semi-circle that will be better for camera 
and staging. She has approved this staging. They all wear 
their priestly garments and hats.  Priest #3 is not wearing 
his hat.  Priest #4 IS HOLDING PRIEST# 3'S HAT IN HIS LEFT 
HAND.  
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES  
10
The number which we have all 
selected is 43.  And remember, 
whoever is chosen for the honor of 
giving the incense offering will 
enjoy the blessing of heaven the 
rest of his life.  Now, all raise a 
finger... 
All priests raise their index fingers in the air using their 
right hands. 
The Overseer begins his count - pointing to each priest, 
using his right hand - starting with the priest to his left 
who had taken off his hat.  
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES (CONT’D)
11
One, two, three,… 
Once we establish the concept that he is going around the 
group in order, from left to right, we dissolve through a 
passage of time for this counting.  
CLOSE PAN FACES OF PRIESTS WITH FINGERS RAISED 
We do NOT see Zechariah or Priest #1 in this shot.

 OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES (O.C.) 
12
(CONT’D)
…sixteen, seventeen, eighteen…
DISSOLVE TO CLOSE ON PRIEST #4 
He is pointing and counting as he look moves L to R. 
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES (CONT’D)
13
Twenty six... twenty seven... 
DISSOLVE TO CLOSE PAN ON HANDS WITH FINGER(s) RAISED  
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES(O.C.)
14
...Forty one, forty two... 
CAMERA SLOWS AND STOPS ON ONE HAND as we hear the final 
number...
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES (O.C.)
15
... forty three. 
ANGLE PANS DOWNWARD AS THE HAND LOWERS AND ANGLE REVEALS IT 
IS ZECHARIAH, humble but pleased at being selected.  
OVERSEER OF THE LOTTERIES(O.C.) 
16
Zechariah, you have been selected 
to perform the incense offering.   
ANGLE WIDENS
Zechariah turns to Priest #1 to his right.
ZECHARIA
17
You also are chosen to serve with 
me.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE HEKAL - LATE AFTERNOON
There are BURNING EMBERS on the altar BUT NO SMOKE IN THE 
ROOM. The menorah is LIT.  The table of SHOW BREAD is 
visible. Zechariah holds the vessel of the incense service. 
(TEMPLE INSTITUTE REF DESCRIBES THIS AS: “a large golden 
spoon which holds the amount of 3 kavim, a...nd a smaller 
vessel, filled to the brim with the incense, and placed 
inside the larger vessel. This prevented any of the incense 
from spilling.”) Zechariah hands it to PRIEST #1 then opens 
and removes the smaller vessel from inside, which he also 
hands to Priest #1.  Priest # 1 then pours some of the 
incense from the smaller vessel into Zechariah’s hands. 
(TEMPLE INT. 
SB #303 John Baptizer's Birth (Roche)- Anicon Draft 3-31-14   4.
 REF description: “He removes the smaller vessel filled with 
incense, and hands it to his companion. The latter deposits 
some of the incense into the palms of the priest.)
Zecharia turns with the incense in his cupped palms and 
CAMERA FOLLOWS Zecharia, thus eliminating Priest #1 from the 
REST OF THE SCENE.  (He has presumably exited during the 
following shots)
ANGLE ON THE ALTAR
Zecharia approaches and sprinkles the incense on the coals.  
The motion is out and away from his body as he lets the 
incense filter out through his fingers like flour.  Gordon 
describes it as “a sweeping motion like casting seeds.”  As 
he does so, the smoke rises. 
Zechariah then prostrates himself in preparation for leaving. 
HIGH ANGLE DOWN
The smoke from the burning incense rises up towards camera.
ANGLE ON THE ALTAR
Suddenly, TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ALTAR (Luke 1:11) IN THE 
SMOKE, we see a soft LIGHT coalesce.
ANGEL GABRIEL LUKE 1:19
18
(whispered/echoing)
Don’t be afraid...
CLOSE ON ZECHARIAH
He looks at the smoky light and squints, trying to see more 
clearly.  His expression changes to surprise, to awe, and 
then to wide-eyed fear.

 CLOSE ON ZECHARIAH
He looks at the smoky light and squints, trying to see more 
clearly.  His expression changes to surprise, to awe, and 
then to wide-eyed fear.
ZECHARIAH
20
(Gasp)
ZECHARIAH’S POV  
ANGEL GABRIEL coalesces from the light inside the smoke and 
stands before Zechariah - an awesome, ten foot tall, 
presence. 
ANGEL GABRIEL (NLT-LUKE 1:14)
21
Don’t be afraid, Zechariah.
CLOSE ON Zechariah - he peeks up from his lowered position.
ANGEL GABRIEL (O.C) (CONT’D)
22
God has heard your prayer.  Your 
wife Elizabeth will give you a son, 
and you are to name him John. 
Zechariah reacts in awe, shading his eyes with one hand. The 
angels feet step THROUGH FRAME. 
ANGEL GABRIEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
23
You will have great joy and 
gladness, and many will rejoice at 
his birth for he will be great in 
the eyes of the Lord.  
HIGH DOWN ANGLE 
Gabriel walks towards the menorah. 
ANGEL GABRIEL (CONT’D)
24
He must never touch wine or 
alcoholic drinks.  He will be 
filled with the holy Spirit even 
before his birth. 
He stops at the menorah and looks up to heaven with arms 
spread.
ANGEL GABRIEL 
25
And he will turn many Israelites to 
the Lord their God. 
CAMERA PUSH IN ON GABRIEL FROM ABOVE
SB #303 John Baptizer's Birth (Roche)- Anicon Draft 3-31-14   6.
 ANGEL GABRIEL 
26
He will be a man with the spirit 
and power of Elijah.
Gabriel turns from the menorah and walks toward Zechariah.
ANGEL GABRIEL (NLT LUKE 1: 17) 
27
(CONT’D)
He will prepare the people for the 
coming of the Lord.
ON ZECHARIAH 
He pushes his upper body up from his lowered position but 
remains on his knees, listening in disbelief.
ANGEL GABRIEL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
28
He will turn the hearts of the 
fathers to their children, and he 
will cause those who are rebellious 
to accept the wisdom of the godly.
He watches Gabriel move around him.  As Gabriel walks back 
towards the altar Zechariah shakes his head in disbelief.
ZECHARIAH (NLT - LUKE 1:18)
29
How can I be sure this will happen? 
I’m an old man now, and my wife is 
also well along in years.
UP ANGLE FAVORS GABRIEL 
He is now back in place at the right side of the altar. His 
looks shift to a slightly more displeased demeanor, but never 
harsh.
ANGEL GABRIEL LUKE 1:19 (ESV)
30
I am Gabriel, who stands in the 
presence of God, and I was sent to 
speak to you and to bring you this 
good news. And behold, you will be 
silent and unable to speak until 
the day that these things take 
place... 
(then softening with 
assurance)
 ...because you did not believe my 
words, which will be fulfilled in 
their time.
Gabriel vanishes back into the smoky backdrop in a slight 
flash of gold light.

 EXT. THE TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET
The 11 PRIESTS stand facing the door of the temple.  (ALL 
PRIESTS MUST BE BAREFOOT) - 
CLOSE ON PRIEST #2 
His eyes turn to the Priest beside him but he doesn’t turn 
his head. 
PRIEST #2
31
(low)
The evening blessing is being 
delayed.  What is taking Zechariah 
so long to perform the incense 
offering?
Suddenly the Priest reacts to the O.C. SOUND OF THE DOOR 
OPENING.
ANGLE AT DOOR
Zechariah steps out with shock on his face.  Priest #1 and 
Priest #2 approach him.
PRIEST #2 
32
Zechariah has seen a vision!
ANGLE ON THE DOOR
Priest #1 pushes out of the temple with his arm around 
Zechariah - who appears stunned... almost staggering and 
holding his throat.
PRIEST #1 (CONT’D)
33
His voice has been taken away! 
PRIESTS
34
(Low wallah - more wonderment and 
awe than surprise of concern) 
TRACKING CLOSE ON ZECHARIAH 
He straightens up and dutifully moves to his place on the 
Temple’s Twelve Steps - passing the other priests.
TRACKING ACROSS THE FACES OF THOSE WATCHING ZECHARIAH
ANGLE ON ZECHARIAH
SB #303 John Baptizer's Birth (Roche)- Anicon Draft 3-31-14   8.
 He reaches his spot in line and faces the temple.  The 
Priests nearest Zechariah eye him in awe and wonder that God 
did this on the day he was chosen to give the offering of 
incense.  
HISTORICAL REF FOR PRODUCTION DESIGN AND BOARD ARTIST - A 
group of Priests stands on the twelve steps - facing TOWARDS 
the temple and away from the court and altar below. HIGHLIGHT 
Zechariah and a smaller group of priests who stand in the 
following order: (From ref) The priests who attended to the 
inner altar's ashes, the menorah's wicks, the shovel, and the 
incense, all stand to the right of their colleagues who 
brought the parts of the sacrifice up to the altar.  THIS 
WILL BE CAMERA LEFT.  See image from page 76 in Temple 
Institute art.  They hold all the vessels they have been 
using in their service: the golden baskets which hold the 
ashes and wicks, the shovel and the incense utensils.
The Priests all bend and place their items on the stairs and 
then all turn to face the court. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Zechariah and the Priests extend their hands. (SEE reference  
- the split finger “live long and prosper” sign - on page 76 
of Temple Institute materials for posing the hands - VERY 
IMPORTANT) Zechariah cannot speak and so he doesn't move his 
lips or join in as they sing NKJV version of the Aaronic 
blessing: Numbers 6:22-26  A POWER GLOW extends from inside 
the temple and shoots through the raised hands of the priests 
as they sing.  During this PUSH IN ON ZECHARIAH absorbing all 
he has heard from the Angel.  
PRIESTS (CONT’D)
35
The Lord bless you and keep you;
The Lord make His face shine upon 
you, And be gracious to you;
The Lord lift up His countenance 
upon you, And give you peace.
The VOICES FADE OUT by the last words of the prayer as we...
CUT TO:
INT. LAB - DAY

their line, starting with GIZMO.  They are leaning in, hands 
on knees, looking at something O.C. on the floor.

 She rises and pulls the bowl off her head.

Uggghhh... That does it!
She grabs a cloth napkin off the table where we see some 
other snacks Phoebe has put out. Apples, Bananas, a plate of 
cookies.
ANGLE ON GIZMO AND CHRIS so we don’t need to see Joy wiping 
the cereal off (Cloth Sim etc issues...)
JOY (CONT’D)
47
Chris, I know your mom is baby-
sitting for Mrs. Petersen, so she 
can go Christmas shopping, but why 
do we have to take the brunt of 
it?! 
Chris and Gizmo approach Joy.
CHRIS
48
Aw, come on, Joy.  Where’s you’re 
holiday spirit?  Besides, I thought 
everybody liked little kids.  
They’re so cute and cuddly.  And...
He plucks an Oaty-O ouf of her hair and pops it in his mouth.

The weight of holding Charlie on his outstretched (O.C.) arm 
causes Gizmo to teeter dangerously.
GIZMO
62
Oh! But who’s got me?!
He start to fall forward.

They are poised in the middle of the foyer as though still

She was just saying how much she 
loves little kids.
PHOEBE
73
Okay.  Great. Why don’t you take

it would never happen.  But it’s 
clear that God must have a special 
plan for me...
