Synopsis: When Chris begins to believe that a mysterious street 
magician possesses real powers, Superbook whisks the kids off to 
historical Galilee where Jesus is performing true miracles like 
healing a cripple, calming a storm on the sea and banishing demons 
from a possessed man.  During the course of their miraculous 
adventure, Chris comes to understand the power to perform miracles 
comes only from God.  When he returns home, he looks a little 
closer and discovers the very clever, but very human machinations 
Miraculo has used to trick his public. 
Take Away:  True Miracles come only from God.

 TEASER
FADE IN:
EXT. VALLEYVIEW SCHOOL - DAY
TRACKING GIZMO as he speeds along in ROBO-ROLLER MODE. (As on

Chris!  Chris, that street magician 
you have had me monitoring

today. Right down the street!
RESUME ON TRIO - Joy squints at the flyer - skeptical.
JOY

A 'magician, Chris?'  Wow.  Does he 
do birthday parties?
CHRIS
9
Oh... that's... you... You know, 
Joy... you won't be talking like 
that when you see what this guy can 
do.  Come on, Giz!
Chris and Gizmo tear off.  Joy shrugs and follows.

Trust me, Joy.  This guy does 
miracles!
Something FLASHES O.S. <POOF!> AUDIENCE <APPLAUDING>.  
REVERSE ANGLE - MIRACULO's performance is in progress.  He is 
flamboyant Chris Angel/David Blaine-type.  A PUFF OF SMOKE 
rises above him, the aftereffect of his previous unseen 
trick.  He turns and smirks at the newest arrivals.
MIRACULO
12
Welcome believers and non-believers

alike.  Now, you know the rules.  
Laugh.  Applaud. Be astounded all 
you like.  But please --
As he points in Chris's direction --

heading straight for Miraculo - who catches it as...!

 CHRIS
13
Whoa!
RESUME MIRACULO - as the phone flies INTO SHOT and <SMACKS> 
into his open-palmed hand.  He grins as he pockets it.

Hmm... Pretty good trick!

knoll in the middle distance. (CHRIS' PHONE IS NOW GONE)
MIRACULO
16
Now, can I offer anyone a front row 
seat?
He gestures sharply.  The PARK BENCH in B.G. DISAPPEARS in a 
PUFF OF SMOKE!
MIRACULO (CONT'D)
17
Oh no! Apparently, I'm too late!

CROWD

skeptically but she is applauding too - only not quite as 
enthusiastically.
ON MIRACULO - He strolls around behind a FOUNTAIN - there is 
a tree about fifteen feet behind him.  
MIRACULO
19
Well, I'm afraid that's all the 
miracles I have in me for today.
Miraculo begins to float upward at an angle; his hands are 
positioned at 7 o'clock & 2 o'clock.  
CROWD

JOY
24
C'mon, Chris!  Everything Miraculo 
did can be explained.  It's just 
tricks.
CHRIS
25
No way, Joy.  Gizmo and I have seen 
plenty of magic acts.  And, no one 
could fake what he just did... not 
out in the open like that.
*
GIZMO's chest compartment opens.  He whips out a deck of 
26
playing cards and shuffles them in the air. 
GIZMO
26
Chris is correct.  And I should 
know.  Doing parlor tricks is one 
of my favorite hobbies!

 JESUS (CEV LUKE 5:23)

Is it easier for me to tell this

<ad-lib cheers and exultations>
ANGLE AT REAR OF CROWD - A surly NAYSAYER, who scowls from 
beneath his shawl. (This Naysayer is SATAN in disguise)
NAYSAYER (SATAN)
55
He obviously works for this Jesus 
of Nazareth. It's mere trickery. 
Like a court magician building his 
reputation.
THE KIDS approach and hear him - CLOSE - Gizmo considers this 
possibility.
GIZMO
56
I am not certain that's -- 
The Naysayer whirls to the kids...

It is exactly how he did it.  And 
you were fooled.  That man was 
never paralyzed to begin with!
The Shepherd Boy steps forward.
SHEPHERD BOY

No.  He has always been like that!

What is it to you, anyway?

CRANE UP as Chris, Joy, Gizmo and the Shepherd Boy climb the 
back side of a hill.  They reach the peak and a FAR SHOT PAST 
THEM REVEALS a (non-animated) CROWD seated on the slope of a 
POCKET VALLEY which serves as a natural AMPHITHEATER.  There 
might be 100 to 200 people.
CHRIS
69
Wow!  You were right.  The crowds 
following Jesus just keep getting 
bigger and bigger! 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo turn in the indicated direction to see --

74
 It began to grow...
A reedy plant is drawn, sprouting. But then:
JESUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
75
...but the plant soon wilted and 
died for lack of moisture....
*
An ERASER appears and quickly erases the sprouts and the 
plant wilts.
ON PHARISEES - not happy; Jesus is at it again.
JESUS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
76
Other seed fell among thorns that 
grew up with it and choked out the 
tender plants.
CLOSE 0N JESUS 
JESUS (CONT'D)
77
Still other seed fell on fertile 
soil.  This seed grew and produced 
a crop that was a hundred times as 
much as had been planted!
He gestures to the crowd, arms wide.
JESUS (CONT'D)
78
Anyone with ears to hear should

Sit with us. 
BACK ON THE GROUP APPROACHING
Chris and Joy exit Frame to sit near O.C. Jesus.  We hold 
Peter, Gizmo and the Shepherd boy who will sit nearby but not 
next to Jesus.  The following exchange will give Chris and 
Joy time O.C. To settle beside Jesus.
GIZMO

Great campfire.

Did anyone bring Marshmallows? 
PETER
83
What are Marshmallows?
GIZMO
84
Uh--- never mind.

him. Chris holds his hands out to warm them at the crackling 
fire.  WE PUSH IN ON HIM AS...
CHRIS
85
Jesus?  You know all that stuff you

you should have done... like... 
another miracle!  That's the kind

following you.

Miracles are a visible sign that 
Jesus has power over the seen and

 AT BOW OF BOAT - Gizmo stands, facing rearward.  A CAPTAIN'S 
HAT pops up on his head as he addresses Chris and Joy.
GIZMO

This is your captain speaking.  
Remember, stay seated at all times, 
keep your hands inside the vessel

"Lost in Space."
GIZMO

Danger, Chris Quantum!  Danger!

 SATAN
103
Nothing I like better than a little 
panic and mayhem. (laughter) -  
Shows human beings how doomed their 
precious little world has become.
CLOSE ON SMALL BOAT - Heaving and tilting.  The Shepherd Boy, 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo grimace as they cling to the sides of 
their tiny craft.  
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
104
(shouts of fear)
IN LARGE BOAT - Simon Peter and Matthew duck under the 
<FLAPPING> TARP that covers the stern of their vessel.  They 
lean over Jesus, pleading.
DISCIPLES
105
(panicked wallah)
SIMON PETER (CEV LUKE 8:24)
106
Master, Master, we are about to 
drown!
CLOSE ON JESUS - as He opens His eyes, utterly calm.
JESUS (NKJV MATTHEW 8:26)
107
Why are you fearful, O you of 
little faith?
NEW ANGLE IN LARGE BOAT - also rising upward, impelled by the 
giant wave.  Jesus raises his hand, like Moses parting the 
Red Sea.  <WINDS ROAR> and LIGHTNING <CRACKLES> as he raises 
his arms and shouts:
JESUS (CONT’D)
108
I REBUKE YOU!
HIGH ANGLE DOWN
Suddenly, a TRANSPARENT SHOCK WAVE OF HEAVENLY POWER radiates 
out from the large boat, rippling the fabric of existence.
ON PEAK - as the expanding SHOCK WAVE <WHOOSHES> by, it blows 
Satan backwards OUT OF SHOT.
SATAN (PARTIAL O.S.)
109
<impact grunt - scream>
RESUME HIGH DOWN SHOT ON BOATS - as the waves, the rain, the 
clouds, every sign of turmoil, instantly dissipates.

 AT SEA LEVEL - The BOATS <SPLASH> down on a glass-smooth sea.  
The sky is clear.  Despite Satan's claim of power here on 
Earth, it is now obvious who truly reigns supreme.
ON SMALL BOAT - A hand, an elbow, and another hand grip the 
*
side.  Soaked, the Shepherd Boy, Joy and Chris peek over the 
edge.  Then Gizmo's hand clamps on and he rises, head askew.
GIZMO
110
<cough, woozy groan>
His Duckie suddenly deflates with a comical sounding 
<FLATULANT HISS>
CLOSE ON CHRIS - He blinks, then glances off toward...
CHRIS
111
Whoa... Did Jesus just stop that 
storm?
CHRIS'S POV OF LARGE BOAT - where the Disciples stagger to 
their feet, wincing and holding their heads.  Jesus stands in 
their midst - arms still raised.  He lowers them as he turns 
in our direction.  He looks over at Chris. 
ON CHRIS IN SMALL BOAT - Chris blinks; it's all too much.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
112
(under)
Awesome.
ZOOM OUT TO INCLUDE Joy, who shoots Chris a look.
JOY
113
Miraculous is more like it. 
PUSH IN ON CHRIS AND GIZMO - Giz whispers to Chris.
GIZMO
114
I do not believe even Miraculo 
could do something that powerful.
CHRIS
115
You know, Giz... I'm starting to 
*
think the same thing.

EXTREME CLOSE ON CHRIS -
X-DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GADARENES - SHORE - EARLY NEXT MORNING
Simon Peter stands up to his waist in the water, securing the 
Large Boat's anchor.  Chris approaches on shore.

 CHRIS
116
Peter?  Can I ask you a question?
CLOSER - Chris sits in the sand, arms around his knees.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
117
That was... I don't know... really 
unbelievable!
ANGLE PAST SIMON PETER - he doesn't look up from tying his 
lines.  Chris is in the B.G.
SIMON PETER
118
You do not trust your own eyes?
CHRIS
119
No, I saw what I saw.  ...I can't 
explain it, but I saw it.
(beat, winces)
Same way I guess I'm still having 
trouble understanding what Jesus 
says.
REVERSE ON SIMON PETER - he chuckles good-naturedly.
SIMON PETER
120
<chuckles>  I know how you feel.  I 
am a simple fisherman and when I 
first began following Jesus....
Beat.  Then he points at the water.
SIMON PETER (CONT'D)
121
Look here.  See the anchor's rope 
*
as it goes into the water?
CLOSE ON CHRIS - he leans forward, squinting at the water.
CHRIS
122
Yeah.
SIMON PETER (O.S.)
123
It appears to be bending in that 
direction, does it not?
CHRIS'S POV - The rope leads into the water and seems to bend 
as it goes beneath the surface.  
CHRIS
124
Sure.
Simon Peter's hand reaches IN and pulls the rope out of the 
sea, showing how the water refracted the light.

 SIMON PETER (O.S.)
125
But it's really over here instead.
ZOOM OUT as Simon Peter holds the dripping anchor above the 
water...
SIMON PETER (CONT'D)
126
The rope seemed to be bent, but it 
wasn't.  It is a trick caused by 
*
the light and the water.
...then lets it drop back under, <SPLUNK!>
SIMON PETER (CONT'D)
127
As a fisherman, I would see this 
kind of deception every day and 
know it for what it is... an 
illusion.
MEDIUM ON CHRIS - he ponders this as Simon Peter <SLOSHES> 
out of the water and kneels on the sand beside him.
CHRIS
128
So, when our eyes tell us one 
thing, the truth may really be 
something else?
Peter nods.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
129
The hard part is -- learning how to 
recognize what's real and what not. 
CLOSE ON SIMON PETER - he smiles.
SIMON PETER
130
What Jesus does -- what He is -- 
that is all very real.  Because his 
words and miracles come from God.
PUSH IN ON CHRIS as he absorbs this.
WIPE TO:
EXT. GADARENES - COUNTRY ROAD - SOON - MORNING
The Disciples, Jesus, our Travelers and the Shepherd Boy walk 
(left to right) along a ROAD that bisects the hilly terrain.
MOVING WITH TRAVELERS - On the opposite (upstage) side of the 
road, on a hillside, there is a CEMETERY dotted with GRAVES 
and TOMBS.

 JOY
131
Hey guys, what's that up there?
SHEPHERD BOY
132
Tombs, where they bury the dead.  
POSSESSED MAN (O.C.)
133
(strange efforts and grunting 
sounds)
FAVORING GIZMO - shakes like Lou Costello, <RATTLING>.
GIZMO
134
Do you think there are g-g-g-
ghosts?
Chris puts a hand on Gizmo's head to stop his <CLATTERING>. 
He jumps in fear.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
135
(scream)
CHRIS
136
There are no such thing as ghosts, 
Gizmo.
Just then, they perk up at distant <O.S. SQUEALING>.
GIZMO
137
Then what's m-making that n-noise? 
*
(nervous giggle)
*
THEIR POV - the road leads over a crest in B.G. TEENAGE (non-
Jewish) HERDER #1 and HERDER #2 lead A LARGE HERD OF SWINE.  
ON JESUS AND DISCIPLES - who looks concerned.
SIMON PETER
138
Rabbi, we must find a way around 
those swine.  Such creatures are 
unclean and dangerous.
POSSESSED MAN (O.S.)
139
(sounds)
JESUS - turns his gaze 180 degrees and looks up at the 
Cemetery on the hill in B.G.  He senses...
JESUS
140
No.  There is something else.

 EXT. GADARENES - HILLSIDE CEMETERY - MEANWHILE - MORNING
There is something moving in the brush but we can't make out 
what it is.
POSSESSED MAN
141
(sounds and grunts)
PAN TO SATAN - hiding by a tomb
SATAN
142
Beware, O Son of God, for in this 
place, the sinful hear my voice.
As he turns, A MAN with GLOWING EYES bounds into view, 
bruised and filthy; he wears broken MANACLES and torn 
CLOTHING.  He looks about, then halts, and cowers in fear.
POSSESSED MAN
143
<rasping, groaning, startled gasp>
ANGLE PAST POSSESSED MAN - Satan stands before him. He points 
sharply, sending the Possessed Man scampering down the hill.
SATAN
144
On your way!
POSSESSED MAN
145
(grunting sounds)
CUT TO:
EXT. GADARENES COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS [MARK 5:1-17]
The Possessed Man scrambles down the hillside AT CAMERA.
POSSESSED MAN
146
(grunting sounds)
DOWN ANGLE ON TRAVELERS AND DISCIPLES - The kids recoil at 
the sight of the Man.  Frightened, Gizmo tucks his head and 
limbs into his torso like a turtle <CLUNK-CLUNK-CLUNK!>
GIZMO
147
Yipe!
CHRIS
148
What's wrong with that man?
ON JESUS - he gazes down at the man with compassion and 
resolve.  
THE POSSESSED MAN take a tentative step towards Jesus.

 CLOSE ON THE POSSESSED MAN - cringing like an abused animal.
POSSESSED MAN (NLT LUKE 8:28)
149
Why are you interfering with me, 
Jesus, Son of the Most High God?
Jesus reach out a kindly hand to the suffering man. The man 
flinches.
POSSESSED MAN (CONT’D (CONT’D)
150
Please, I beg you, do not torture 
me!
CLOSE ON JESUS AND THE MAN 
The man goes down low and Jesus goes to his knees with him.  
Jesus picks up the man's manacled wrist and holds it up.
JESUS (NLT MARK 5:8)
151
Come out of the man, you evil 
spirit.  What is your name?
CLOSE ON POSSESSED MAN - he grimaces in pain.
POSSESSED MAN (NLT MARK 5:9)
152
My name is Legion, because there 
are many of us inside this man. Do 
not send us far away. Send us into 
those pigs.  Let us enter them.
JESUS - considers this.  Then he nods.
JESUS
153
Go.
There is a RUSH OF WIND - Jesus' hair blows a bit - there is 
an O.C. GLOW - 
Then a powerful rush of LIGHT EFFECT swirls from the 
possessed man and heads O.C....
UP THE ROAD - the Herders react as the FIRST FEW SWINE at the 
head of the herd and caught in the LIGHT EFFECT and rear up.  
Their EYES GLOW as they surge forward.  
DOWN THE ROAD - <STAMPEDING HERD SFX BUILD THROUGHOUT>.  
Simon Peter step into CLOSE-UP and shouts:
SIMON PETER
154
Quick!  Out of the way!
QUICK CUT - GIZMO IN ROAD - he <POPS> out of his torso.  
Chris grabs him by the scruff and yanks him OUT OF SHOT.

GIZMO
155

DU-OH!

[CAMERA SHAKE]  Chris turns his head and double-takes.
HERDER #1
156
They're running for the cliffs!
They race off after their herd.
HERDER #1 (CONT’D)
157
Stop!  Nooooo!!!
REACTION SHOT - Chris gapes, awestruck.
WIDE - The last of the herd charges OUT OF SHOT <STAMPEDE SFX 
FADE> and the DUST SETTLES.  
ANGLE FAVORING JESUS - as he helps the formerly Possessed Man 
get to his feet.  Although he is still unkempt, and despite 
his tears of joy, his expression is serene.  His voice is 
calm.
POSSESSED MAN
158
Let me follow you, Lord.
CLOSE ON JESUS - He smiles kindly but shakes his head 'no.'
JESUS (NLT MARK 5:19)
159
No, go home to your family, and 
tell them everything the Lord has 
done for you and how merciful he 
has been.
ANGLE ON SATAN - Up the hill
SATAN
160
Jesus, we are far from through, you 
and I.  Far from through!
He whirls and vanishes in his signature effect.
DOWN THE HILL - ON THE ROAD - ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They look across at Jesus, the disciples and the man who has 
had the demons cast out.

 CHRIS
161
That was amazing, Jesus just... I 
mean do you guys realize what we've 
seen! Jesus has power over man, 
over nature, and even over things 
that are... unseen. 
*
DOWN ON THE ROAD
Chris approaches Jesus.  Jesus knows his thoughts.
JESUS
162
Chris, go tell others all that you 
have seen and heard. I  will always 
be with you. 
Chris nods as Jesus turns and joins the Disciples and the 
Shepherd boy, a short distance away. Joy and Gizmo approach 
Chris.
JOY
163
What did Jesus say to you?
CHRIS
164
You know, I think it's the first 
thing I really, really understand.
Suddenly, the SUPERBOOK AFFECT COMES UP and whisks them away.
GIZMO
165
Hey, we're on our way home!

(Excited laughter)  All right!

Here we go-o-o!

Chris, Joy and Gizmo MATERIALIZE near the fountain where 
Miraculo made his earlier appearance.  The park's deserted.
CHRIS
166
Come on! I gotta check something 
out!  
He runs back to the FOUNTAIN and stares in the water.  
CLOSE ON CHRIS - as he considers...

THE ANCHOR SCENE)
Chris looks on as Simon Peter points at the water.
SIMON PETER
167
See the anchor's rope as it goes 
into the water? It appears to be 
bending in that direction. 
Simon Peter holds the dripping anchor above the water...
SIMON PETER (CONT'D)
168
The rope seemed to be bent, but it 
*
wasn't.  It is a trick caused by 
*
the light and the water.
MORPH BACK OUT 
TO:
EXT. VALLEYVIEW PARK FOUNTAIN - DAY - (RESUME PRESENT)
Chris's hand reaches in the water, fishes around and then 
pulls up a thin, almost invisible cable.  
CAMERA PANS its length (SUNLIGHT GLINTS off of it so we can 
see it).  It feeds through a BRACKET AND PULLEY mounted 
behind the fountain - Chris follows it as Joy and Gizmo 
approach.
JOY
169
What is that, Chris?
Chris follows the almost invisible line up to the big tree.  
POV IN THE BRANCHES - More PULLEYS and MOTORIZED WINCHES are 
tucked in the branches.
CHRIS (O.S.)
170
Well, what do you know.
QUICK CUT - Chris slips his foot through a loop on the cable.
ANGLE ON OY AND GIZMO - they suddenly react startled at what 
Chris is doing O.C.
GIZMO
171
Whoa!
JOY
172
How are you doing that?!

 CHRIS - seemingly levitates up from behind the fountain, 
floating at an angle toward the tree.  His hands are 
positioned like Miraculo's were, at 7 o'clock & 2 o'clock.
HIS POV - DOWN ANGLE ON JOY AND GIZMO - who calls upward:
GIZMO
173
You can levitate! It is a miracle!
*
UP ANGLE ON CHRIS - hands wrapped around the cable.
CHRIS
174
No it isn't.  Gizmo, I need a metal 
detector scan with a cross 
vibrational thermal overlay!
GIZMO TURN ON HIS VISOR RAY CREATING AN INFRARED VFX, 
REVEALING a clear shot of the CABLE leading from Chris's 
hand, down to his feet, then up to his other hand, then off 
toward the tree.
GIZMO (O.S.)
175
Chris, you are standing on a wire!
CLOSER AT FOUNTAIN - as Chris descends, Joy and Gizmo hurry 
over.  The CABLE <WOBBLES> as he hops off.  He steadies it.
CHRIS
176
You were right, Joy.  It was just a 
trick.  A good trick -- but 
definitely no miracle.
MIRACULO (O.S.)
177
Hey, what do you think you're 
doing?
WIDER ANGLE - as Miraculo crosses over to them, frowning.
MIRACULO (CONT'D)
178
Hands off my stuff.
(beat, looks askance)
Wait a sec.  Weren't you here 
earlier?
JOY
179
Yes, we were.
MIRACULO
180
(self-satisfied smirk)
Soooo -- did you come back to see 
another miracle?
He does a flourish and a deck of fanning cards appears in his 
hand.

 CHRIS
181
Look, no offense, but what you do 
are no miracles.
MIRACULO
182
Hmph. What makes you so sure?
*
CHRIS
183
Because we've seen the real thing.
Chris nods to Joy and Gizmo.  They return his nod, pivot and 
walk away.
MEDIUM ON MIRACULO - who calls after them:
MIRACULO
184
Oh yeah?  So who's my competition?  
Who's better than me?
MEDIUM ON CHRIS - who turns... and simply points skyward.
CHRIS
185
God's the only true miracle worker.
On Chris's smile, as he turns away and continues walking with 
Joy and Gizmo.  
Camera PANS UP TO A BEAUTIFUL CLOUD LADEN SKY AT SUNSET AND 
WE...
FADE OUT.
