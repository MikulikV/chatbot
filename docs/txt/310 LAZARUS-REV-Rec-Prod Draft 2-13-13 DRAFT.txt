smile from Him.
10 YEAR OLD GIRL 
3
Did you come all the way across 
the desert? 
JUDAS
4
Yes we did. Now, please allow us 
to make our way.   
Jesus puts his hands around the shoulder of each child.
 JESUS
5
Judas.  Who better to greet us 
than the children?  Have I not 
told you - the Kingdom of God 
belongs to those who are like 
these Children.
Jesus continues with the children.  Judas scowls, shakes 
his head and follows. Peter looks at Judas.
PETER
6
He has told us that before, Judas.
JUDAS
7
Hmmm...
ANGLE NEAR THE WELL
ELDER #1, ELDER #2 and LAZARUS watch the arrival of the 
travels - fifty yards away. 
ELDER #1
8
That is quite a large group of 
travelers.   
ELDER #2
9
Where do you suppose they are 
from?
Lazarus looks more closely and suddenly brightens, 
leaping to his feet.
LAZARUS
10
Those are not strangers!  That is 
my friend, Jesus, among them!  
Lazarus hurries O.C.  The Elders exchange a LOOK.
ELDER #1
11
Jesus?  When He was here before He 
did not have so many followers. 
Suddenly, PHARISEE #1 AND PHARISEE #2 enter FRAME, 
looking off at the arriving group.
PHARISEE #1
12
I hope you are not impressed with 
this false prophet like your 
friend Lazarus.
The Elders look up, startled to see the High Priest.
ELDER #1
13
Uh... Certainly not.

to have so many followers now.
CLOSER ON PHARISEE #1 - watching Jesus and Lazarus.

Lazarus, how are your sisters?
LAZARUS
19
Mary and Martha are well.  Come, 
they’ll never forgive me if I do 
not bring you right away to see 
them.
Lazarus leads Jesus away. 
Judas, Peter and John hold back. They eye the crowd.  
Judas indicates with a head nod.
JUDAS
20
Look there.
POV -PHARISEE #1 glaring, still holding the stone.
BACK ON PETER AND JUDAS - they look at one another.
JUDAS
21
We need to do something.
PETER
22
Once the priests and Pharisees 
realize Jesus is destined to be 
King, they will understand.

 JOHN
23
Yes, but until they do, He is in 
danger.

BACK ON PHARISEE #1
He glares as Jesus passes nearby with Lazaraus and the 
children.

 INT. LAZARUS’ COURTYARD - DAY
Martha moves about, working hard, putting food out.  She 
removes freshly baked bread from a stone oven.  Martha 
stops, stressed, and looks to the other end of the 
courtyard where she sees --
MARTHA’S POV - Jesus talks to Mary who sits at his feet.  
Others, including his disciples are listening. 
RESUME MARTHA - looking disgusted.  
MARTHA
30
Ughh... so much to do and she just 
sits there.
ANGLE ON JESUS AND GROUP
As everyone listens to Jesus, Martha ENTERS.
MARTHA
31
Lord, doesn’t it seem unfair to 
you that my sister just sits here 
while I do all the work? Tell her 
to come and help me. (Luke 10:40, 
NLT).
Jesus looks up.
JESUS
32
(NKJV Luke, 10:41-42) - Martha, 
Martha, you are worried and 
troubled about many things. But 
one thing is needed, and Mary has 
chosen that good part, which will 
not be taken away from her.” -- 
FAVOR MARTHA
She eyes the dinner.
MARTHA 
33
(to herself)
But... what about the meal?
Then she looks back at the tableau of Jesus with Mary at 
his feet, listening. She now understands.
FADE TO BLACK.

 As she speaks the screen SPLITS so WE SEE:
EXT. QUANTUM BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

he talks on his cell. He wears his skate helmet, knee 
pads and elbow pads.
CHRIS

GIZMO stands nearby, his screen showing an ever-
increasing digit with each bounce.  
GIZMO

Five hundred seventy-nine.  Half 
way to the record, Chris.
JOY
44
My mom’s car broke down and I’ll 
miss the bus.  Can you and Gizmo 
give me a ride?
CHRIS
45
But Joy, I’m half-way to the World 
Record for pogo bounces.  
JOY
46
Chris, please.  
Chris stops bouncing, deflated. 
GIZMO
47
Chris!  You can’t stop now!  Oh... 
the record was almost yours.

whipping out his skateboard.

JOY
51
Thanks guys!  Let’s rocket!

EXT. FRONT OF VALLEYVIEW MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY
A VAN sits at the curb.  Gizmo zooms IN.  As our trio 
screeches to a stop. Joy hops out of Gizmo’s hatch and

Ugghhh!  I was supposed to be on 
that bus!
Arnold points in to the passenger seat.
ARNOLD
56
Matty here missed it, too.  But 
she did it on purpose.
MATTY, 6, sits in her CHILD CAR SEAT.  Joy and Chris peer 
in through the open window.  Matty looks out at them.
CHRIS
57
You didn’t want to go to Wonder 
World Park?  
GIZMO
58
I understand it has Roller 
coasters, water rides and merry-go-
rounds!  Very exciting.
Matty shrugs and looks down.
MATTY
59
I dunno... 
ANGLE OUTSIDE VAN - the kids look to Arnold. He speaks 
low.
ARNOLD
60
She’s the shyest kid at Angels 
Rescue.  Wouldn’t even get out of 
the car when all the other kids 
were getting on the bus - Oh 
well...  Come on, Matty.  We’ll go 
back home.
ANGLE FAVORING JOY AND CHRIS as Arnold gets back into the 
van and they drive off.  Joy looks after them, sad.
JOY

According to my geo sensors we are 
on the outskirts of Jerusalem, in 
the first century A.D. 
RESUME ON CHRIS AND JOY- looking around.
CHRIS
69
I wonder why Superbook dumped us 
here in the middle of nowhere?
ANGLE GIZMO’S HEAD - looking around.
GIZMO
70
Not exactly nowhere, Chris.  I 
detect a small group of people 
ahead.  And according to past 
adventure reference archives, that 
one is Jesus of Nazareth.
RESUME KIDS - as they race up the hill.  
Gizmo’s body is below as his head ratchets down.  His 
head pops INTO PLACE and then he races up after them.
EXT. HILLTOP - CONTINUOUS
The kids and Gizmo arrive NEAR An OLIVE TREE, BUSH AND 
ROCK that can hide them from Jesus and the others a 
distance away.  
Jesus, John, Judas and Peter are with the other  nine 
disciples a 3 NT MEN/2 WOMEN and one FRAIL OLD MAN   
Jesus is tenderly holding the hand of the frail old man, 
who lies on a pallet. 
RESUME KIDS - as they watch Jesus and his disciples.
CHRIS
71
The men with Him are John,  Peter 
and Judas.  We met them when....
He is cut off as SUPERBOOK appears. He ducks back...

that man who was crippled.

that storm. 
They see Jesus CALM the storm. Gizmo peeks out.
GIZMO
75
(relieved)
Yes, that is better.
JOY
76
I can’t believe we got to see 
those miracles with our own eyes. 
The Holograph CLOSES.
CHRIS
77
But why do you think Superbook’s 
reminding us about them now?
They turn to look at...
ANGLE JESUS, FOLLOWERS AND OTHERS
Jesus continues to minister to the old man.

EXT. JESUS’ JORDAN RIVER ENCAMPMENT - DAY
They are on the EAST SIDE OF THE JORDAN RIVER looking 
west. (Please remain accurate when depicting sun 
direction)  The kids and Gizmo head toward Jesus who is 
tending the old man.  Before they can reach Him, Judas 
spots them and immediately picks up a basket of bread 
sitting at his feet. He thrusts it into Chris’ hands.
JUDAS
81
Are you here to help serve bread 
to Jesus’ followers. Take it.  Go.

Judas walks off to speak with Peter. Chris looks at the 
food.

We have had to flee Bethany and 
then Jerusalem because there are 
those who feel his followers are a 
threat.

They move toward Jesus to hear what the message says.
ANGLE JESUS, PETER, JUDAS AND JOHN
as they gather around.
PETER
89
What is it, Lord? 
JESUS
90
It’s a message from Martha and 
Mary.  My friend Lazarus is very 
sick (John, 11: 1-4, CEV).

We should leave now, Lord.  Before 
it is too late.

(record alts.)
(John 11:4, CEV) - His sickness 
won’t end in death.  It will bring 
glory to God and his Son. (NKJV) 
Lazarus’s sickness will not end in 
death. No, it happened for the 
glory of God so that the Son of 
God will receive glory from this. 
NLT - Lazarus’s sickness will not 
end in death. No, it happened for 
the glory of God so that the Son 
of God will receive glory from 
this.

rapidly bouncing on his futuristic pogo stick.  Joy sits

wait here.  Chris, you still need 
to set that record. Death is... so 
permanent.  And you heard - there 
are people out to get Jesus and 
his followers... with big stones!
Gizmo opens his chest and hands Chris his pogo stick.

No.  Come on, guys  I want to find 
out what Jesus means.  He didn’t 
go help his friend before... and

Maybe this is one thing Jesus 
can’t fix.
ANGLE TOMB ENTRANCE - Jesus steps back as Lazarus, still 
wrapped in the shroud which is now partly unwound, walks 
out of the tomb. (DESIGN NOTE: Pay particular attention 
to how the wraps will work on his body.  It was discussed 
at table Read but no decisions were made.  The bodies 
were completely wrapped - not each leg wrapped separately 
- so we’ll have to create a design that allows the wraps 
to be undone but covering Lazarus.)

you consider that it is expedient for us[e] that one man 
should die for the people, and not that the whole nation
