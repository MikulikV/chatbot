 God loves you so much.
God loves you and wants you to follow Him with your whole life. This is 
called becoming a Christian—and it is the most important decision you will 
ever make.
You become a Christian when you:
God loves us, but we are separated from God and His love because of our 
sin. Sin is when we do wrong things or make bad choices; choices that are 
different than what God would want us to do. 
For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard 
(Romans 3:23).
God sent His only Son Jesus to save us. Jesus was born more than 2,000 
years ago and lived a sinless life. Jesus died on a cross to take the 
punishment for our sin, and came back to life three days later. This act of love 
bridged the gap between you and God! 
 
 
 God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while 
we were still sinners (Romans 5:8). The wages of sin is death, but the free gift 
of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).
For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son,  
so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life 
(John 3:16).
BECOMING
a Christian
l ADMIT tha t you are separated from God.
l BELIEVE that Jesus  died and rose again 
to be your Savior.
 4
 
  
 
 
Jesus is the way to eternal life with God. Asking God for 
forgiveness and accepting Jesus as your Savior will begin your 
relationship with God here on earth, as well. 
 
 
If we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness (1 John 1:9). If you 
confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart 
that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9). 
For his Spirit joins with our spirit to afﬁrm that we are God’s children 
(Romans 8:16)
 Would you like to get reconnected to God and ask Jesus to 
become your friend right now?
 
BECOMING
a Christian (cont.)
l CONFESS yo ur sin and  
commit your life to God.
 l JESUS made it possible for you  
 
to experience God’s love!

PRAY:  Dear God, I admit that I am a sinner and that 
I want to have a relationship with You. Please forgive me 
for all of the wrong things I have done. I believe in my 
heart that Jesus died and rose again to take away my 
sin, and I declare Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. 
Please fill me with Your Holy Spirit 
that I may be faithful to You. 
Thank you for saving me and 
for letting me become Your 
child. Please speak to me 
and help me to hear Your 
voice and to follow Your 
ways. I look forward to 
spending time with 
You, both here on 
earth and in 
heaven. In 
Jesus’ name I 
pray, amen.

For his Spirit joins with 
our spirit to affirm that 
we are God’s children.

DAY 2
TWO BIRTHDAYS
PRAY:  Dear God, thank you for loving me and making 
me a part of Your family. Help me understand what it 
means to be born again and to be Your child. Amen.
Can you imagine what it would be like to 
have two birthdays?
Imagine if you had two birthdays and could celebrate twice! What 
would you do? 1. ______________________  2. ______________________
Guess what? You really DO have two birthdays! Every Christian has 
two birthdays: the first one is the day that you were born physically, 
and the second is the day you were born spiritually into God’s family.
The Bible says that when we accept Jesus into our hearts, 
we are “born again.” To find out about it, read  
John 3:1-3. It tells about Nicodemus, a religious man 
who believed that Jesus was a teacher sent by God. 
Jesus told him something that he found difficult to 
understand. Do you understand it? To find out what it was, read  
John 3:1-3 and use the code below to help you find the answer.
Jesus said, you must...
__  __     __  __  __  __     __  __  __  __  __
Remember, being born again is another way of saying that you have 
become a child of God. Once, you were born into your own family—
but the day you were born again by accepting Jesus, you were born 
into God’s family. Happy Birthday to you!

Have you ever seen one of those TV programs 
where someone gets a total makeover? They end 
up looking completely different from when you first 
saw them: different hairstyle, different makeup, and 
different clothes. 
But guess what? Inside, they’re still the same.  
When people become Christians they get a total 
makeover on the inside. They may not look different, 
but they really are different! The Bible says that 
when we accept Jesus we become a new 
creation!  
DO: In the wordsearch, find the words written 
below in purple capital letters in the Bible verse.
READ: 2 Corinthians 5:17 
This means that ANYONE who 
BELONGS to CHRIST has become a 
NEW PERSON. The OLD life is GONE; 
a new LIFE has BEGUN!
Have you ever seen how a caterpillar 
becomes a 
butterfly? It’s the 
same creature—
and yet totally 
different. A caterpillar crawls, but a butterfly flies! It’s 
a miracle. And what happens to us when we are born 
again through Jesus is very similar. Before, we were like 
caterpillars; but through Jesus, we become new creatures!
PRAY:  Dear Lord, I am so excited that I belong to Jesus and 
that I have begun a whole new life as a new creature. Help me 
to think and act in the way that I should, as a brand-new 
creature—as a child of God!

DAY 4
Have you ever seen how newborn babies grow? 
They become more and more like their parents. We 
say they are “maturing.” First they learn to crawl, 
then to walk, and then to run! Write down how old 
you were when you began to crawl and walk.
As a newborn Christian, you’re going to grow and mature spiritually. 
Every day that you grow, you’re going to be more like Jesus! It’s 
amazing, isn’t it? 
 
Draw lines to match the activity picture to the correct word.
Jesus came to earth as a baby, but He also grew in these ways.
  
DO: In the crossword puzzle, write the words below in purple capital 
letters in the Bible verse below.
READ: Luke 2:52 
LUKE writes: Jesus GREW in WISDOM [mental] 
and in STATURE [physical] and in FAVOR with 
GOD [spiritual] and all the PEOPLE [social].
Being born again means that we are just 
starting out in our spiritual life with God. Just 
as babies must learn to crawl and then walk,  
so we must learn how to live our new life with 
God. You’ve begun an exciting journey!
PRAY:  Dear Lord, I want to grow just as Jesus did. 
Help me to grow spiritually, so that every day I look 
and behave more like Jesus. Amen.

As everyone knows, babies need milk to grow. But what kind of milk 
does a spiritual newborn need to grow? Can you guess?
DO: Use this code to ﬁll in the missing words below.
READ: 1 Peter 2:2-3 
and 2 Timothy 3:14-17
Did you ﬁgure it out? The Bible is described as  
spiritual milk! Drinking real milk helps us grow  
strong physically—and reading the Bible helps  
us grow strong spiritually. Isn’t that amazing?
So are you drinking your “supermilk”? If you 
read the Bible every day, you’ll grow strong  
spiritually!
PRAY:  Dear Lord, I want to grow strong spiritually. May I be  
like a newborn baby and want the pure, spiritual “supermilk”  
that comes with reading the Bible every day! Amen.
FOOD FOR GROWTH
To help them grow, babies need __ __ __ __ (Jigf),  
__ __ __ __ (rPst), __ __ __ __ __ __ __ (ZgothPs),

Have you ever seen how big and tall and strong a tree can grow? The 
Bible uses the image of a tree to show how we can grow as Christians.
DO: Fill in the missing vowels:  
A, E, E, I, I, O, U
READ: Psalm 1:1-3  
The Bible says that 
those who delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it 
day and night are like what?
Underline the correct plant: 
GRASS    VINE    WHEAT    TREE    BUSH
But what does that mean exactly?
To delight in the law of the Lord means:
A.   Laugh at God’s law, the Bible
B.   Enjoy reading and obeying the Bible 
To meditate on it day and night means: 
A.   Read the Bible thoughtfully every day
B.   Think about reading the Bible
So if you read the Bible every day and study what 
it says, you will grow to be spiritually strong and 
solid, just like a mighty tree!
PRAY:  Dear Lord, I want to grow strong as a Christian by 
reading the Bible every day, by thinking about it, and by  
putting into practice what I learn from it. Amen.

How many times do you look in a mirror every day? 
once ____   twice ____   5 times ____   more ____
Have you ever looked in the 
mirror and noticed that your hair 
was all messed up? Or maybe you 
noticed that you had something 
stuck in your teeth—yuck! Or maybe 
you noticed there was a smudge of dirt 
on your cheek! We use mirrors to show us 
what’s wrong—so that we can fix it! We can comb our hair, we can 
brush our teeth, and we can wash our faces!
The Bible is just like a mirror. It shows us what we cannot see without it. 
It shows us where we have things that need to be changed or fixed. But 
after we see what’s wrong, we have to take action. That’s what it means 
to obey God!
READ: James 1:22-25
James describes the Bible as being like a mirror. 
When we look into God’s Word,

every way, fully EQUIPPED for every GOOD thing God wants us 
to do.

DAY 10
Praying is important! But how should we pray? When the disciples 
asked Jesus how to pray, He taught them a prayer that we now call 
“the Lord’s Prayer.”
READ: Matthew 6:9-13
Draw a line from each part of the Lord’s Prayer to the correct 
meaning in a box. The first one has been done for you.
Our Father in heaven,
may your name be kept holy.
May your Kingdom come soon.
May your will be done on earth,  
as it is in heaven.
Give us today the food we need,
and forgive us our sins, as we have  
forgiven those who sin against us.
And don’t let us yield to temptation,
but rescue us from the evil one.
There are many ways to talk to God in prayer—but 
one of the best is to pray the Lord’s Prayer, just as 
Jesus and the disciples did. Why not pray it right 
now, quietly or out loud, thinking about what the 
words mean as you pray?
A PRAYER
God’s kingdom is where He rules.
God is the perfect father.  
We can trust Him to take care of us.
Show respect to God, who is holy 
by nature and by name.
We ask God to keep us safe  
from Satan, the evil one.
May God’s plans be carried 
out in the world.
We ask God to keep us from things that 
tempt us to do wrong or difficulties too 
hard for us to cope with.
We ask God to forgive us 
and we must forgive others.
Don’t worry about the future. 
Pray for what you need.

When we discover something exciting, we usually 
want to tell others. One of the most exciting things 
we can imagine is the idea that we are God’s 
children! So we should tell others about it. In fact, 
God wants us to tell others!
READ: Mark 5:19-20

When we tell others about Jesus, our own faith grows stronger. Telling 
others about Jesus is one of the ways that we can grow spiritually!
Think of someone you can tell about these wonderful things the Lord 
has done for you:
Jesus loves me. I am forgiven. He died for my sins. I am God’s child.
TELL OTHERS
PRAY:  Dear Lord, thank you for all of the amazing and 
wonderful things You’ve done for me! Help me to tell 
others about those things in a way that will bless them and 
show them Your love. Amen.

PRAY:  Dear Lord, help me to watch my thoughts and to

You. Please help me to do that. Amen.
We all know that what we do is important. But did you know that the 
Bible says that what we think is just as important?
That’s because what we think influences our attitudes and 
our actions. The Bible tells us to “think right” so that our 
actions will be right too!
READ: Philippians 4:8
DO: Fill in the words from the Bible passage that 
describe right thinking.
Fix your thoughts on what is _________, and 
__________, and ________, and _________, and 
________, and __________. Think about things 
that are ________, and worthy of __________.
We need to watch our thoughts, and perhaps even change the way we 
think about some things. Use the code to 
answer the following questions.
When a thought comes into your mind,  
ask yourself:
Is it — — — — ? (20,18,21,5)
Is it — — — — ? (11,9,14,4)
Is it — — — — ? (16,21,18,5)
Is it — — — — — ? (18,9,7,8,20)
The Bible says that how we think really affects how we act. So to obey 
God and please God, we have to get our thoughts in line with His 
thinking too!

James 3:3-6: 3 We can 
make a large horse go 
wherever we want by means of 
a small bit in its mouth. 4And a 
small rudder makes a huge 
ship turn wherever the pilot 
chooses to go, even though the 
winds are strong.  
5 In the same way, the tongue is 
a small thing that makes grand 
speeches. But a tiny spark can 
set a great forest on fire. 6And 
the tongue is a flame of fire. It 
is a whole world of wickedness, 
corrupting your entire body. It 
can set your whole life on fire, 
for it is set on fire by hell itself.
DAY 14
What we do is important and what we think is important. But did you 
know that, according to the Bible, what we say is important too?
READ: James 1:26
Fill in the missing word. We should  
____________________ our tongues.
According to the Bible, the tongue is  
small but it can be very powerful.
READ: James 3:3-6  
As Christians, we have  
to control our tongues  
and watch what we say. 
James gives us three pictures to  
show how powerful our tongues,  
and our words, can be.
DO: Write the verse number next  
to each picture.
The words we speak affect how we think and what we do. So to obey 
God, we have to be careful of what we say!
WATCH YOUR WORDS
PRAY:  Dear Lord, please help me to control my tongue, 
and help me only to speak words that are pleasing to 
You. As Psalm 19:14 says, “May the words of my mouth ... 
be pleasing to you, O Lord.” Amen.

rules. They help us to live right and to obey Him.
Imagine what would happen if you were driving on a road with no 
rules! What rules of the road can you remember? Draw road signs in 
the shapes below.
Imagine what would happen if there were no rules for motorists (and 
pedestrians) to follow! Just as there are rules for drivers, there are rules 
for living. And God has given us those rules to protect us and to help 
us live lives that are pleasing to Him.
The Ten Commandments (see Exodus 20) 
are summed up by Jesus in two main 
commandments.

DAY 17
The Jordan River flows into the Sea of Galilee and the Sea 
of Galilee flows into the Dead Sea, but no water flows out of the Dead 
Sea! The Sea of Galilee is full of fish and living plants, but the Dead Sea is 
dead—it has no animal or plant life in it!
If we receive God’s love and pass it on, we’re like the Sea of Galilee—
full of life. But if we receive God’s love and don’t pass it on, we are 
like the Dead Sea—dead! God wants us to pass along His love!
READ: Matthew 25:34-40

How many sources of power do you know about? Here are a few. Can 
you think of others? Write the name of each kind of power you see in the 
pictures below. 
Power is defined as “strength, force or might; the ability to do or act.”
As Christians, we have a special source of power that helps us 
live the way God wants us to. Do you know what our source of 
power is?
For the answer, shade in only the shapes with dots.
To find out something we can do as a result 
of this power, read Acts 1:8.
According to the Bible, the Holy Spirit 
empowered the disciples to spread the 
Good News of Jesus throughout the  
whole world. And today, the Holy Spirit 
empowers us to do the same thing—tell 
people about Jesus!
PLUG INTO POWER

DAY 20
Jesus used the illustration of a grapevine to help us understand how 
 important it is for us to be connected to Him.
In John 15:5 Jesus said: I am the vine; you are the branches. Those 
who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart 
from me you can do nothing.
If we are connected to Jesus, like a branch is connected to the trunk of 
a tree, we will produce the good fruit of the Holy Spirit.
READ: Galatians 5:22-23

DAY 22
The Holy Spirit gives everyone different 
gifts! A talent is a natural ability to do 
something 
well. But when 
we become 
Christians, the 
Holy Spirit gives 
us supernatural 
abilities.

Have you ever been in a car that used a GPS (Global 
Positioning System) as a navigating device? If the 
driver ignores the map and instructions and drives  
in the wrong direction, the voice from the GPS may

READ: Luke 15:11-19
DO: Trace the route the young man took when he went his own way.
The man finally “came to his senses” (verse 17) and realized that he 
had sinned by going his own way.
GOING YOUR OWN WAY
PRAY:  Dear Lord, help me always to 
listen to Your instructions so that I 
don’t go my own way and get lost. 
But if I do make a mistake, please 
help me come to my senses and 
turn to You. Help me to recalculate 
and follow Your instructions so that I can be 
on the right path again. Amen.

DAY 24
WELCOME HOME
How do you celebrate when someone comes home after being away 
for a long time?
READ: Luke 15:20-24
The son realized that he had done wrong by going his own way and 
wasting his inheritance money. He was prepared to go back home and 
be a servant.
When we do something 
wrong, God, like the 
father in this story, never 
stops loving us. He will 
forgive us if we are sorry  
for our sins and tell Him. He rejoices to welcome us back. 
Cross out the ﬁrst word and then cross out every other  
word to continue the story.

Can you tell what I am? 
READ: 1 Peter 1:7
During what’s called the refining process, impurities are 
removed so what’s left is pure gold. In a similar way, trials and hardships 
in our lives refine us. They help God remove the impurities from our lives 
and make our faith strong and pure.
How should we respond when troubles come our way?
READ: James 1:2-4
To use what James says, circle the correct word in each bracket in the 
prayer below.
TESTING TIME
I am hidden in rocks deep in the ground,
But with mining tools I can be found.
Separate me from the ore and the sand;
Smelt me with the hottest heat I can stand.
Throw away all that is not pure;
And what’s left is valuable, you can be sure.
Use me for money or jewelry for young and old.
I am very, very precious, because I am ________________ .
PRAY:  Dear Lord, whenever 
troubles come my way, may I 
consider it [a gift, an opportunity] 
for great [joy, peace]. For when 
my faith is [growing, tested], 
my [endurance, honesty] has a 
chance to grow. So I will let it 
grow. For when my endurance is 
fully developed, I will be  
[weak, strong] in character and 
[ready, late] for anything. Amen.

DAY 28
WHY WORRY?
PRAY:  Dear Lord, I’m concerned about ________________ and 
________________ . Please help me to know that You don’t 
want me to worry about these things, but that You want me to 
trust You. I put these things in Your hands right now, knowing 
that You love me and that I can trust You with all my problems. 
Amen.
Rate your worries 
below according to 
this rating scale:
READ: Philippians 4:6-7
Don’t WORRY about anything; instead, 
pray about everything. Tell GOD what 
you NEED, and THANK him for ALL he 
has done. Then you will experience God’s 
peace, which exceeds anything WE can 
understand. His peace will GUARD your HEARTS 
and MINDS as you live in Christ Jesus. 
DO: In the wordsearch, find the same words that 
are in RED in the verse above, and cross them 
out. Use the remaining letters to find out what can 
replace “worry.” Write the answer on the line below.
In the prayer below, write one or two things that worry you, and then 
pray to Him about them.
1. You haven't done your homework.
2.  You came home later than you were 
supposed to.
3.  You forget to do the household 
chores you are responsible for.
4. The school bully is on your case.
5. There are so many wars in the world.
I’m cool. Not    
  worried at all.
I’m only a little 
  worried. No one 
   would know.
I'm quite worried.
  Does it show?
I'm a nervous wreck!
  It shows!
Did you know that God commands us to not worry, but  
to pray instead? The Bible teaches us in 1 Peter 5:7 that  
we can give all our worries and cares to God, for He  
cares about us.

DAY 30
To live the Christian life successfully, God actually tells us to put on a 
suit of armor—not armor made of metal, but something 
even more important!
In Jesus’ time, the Romans ruled in Israel. So Roman soldiers 
were everywhere! In the Bible, the apostle Paul used the 
illustration of Roman armor to teach Christians how to defeat 
the devil and live victorious lives.
READ: Ephesians 6:10-18
Write the number of the correct piece of armor 
next to each description.
EQUIPPED FOR VICTORY
PRAY:  Dear Lord, thank you 
for giving me all the equipment 
I need to fight the enemy, the 
devil. Help me to use every 
piece of the armor You have given 
me so that I can live a victorious 
Christian life to Your glory. Amen. 
1. Belt of truth 
2. Breastplate or body armor  3. Shoes 
4. Shield of faith 
5. Helmet of salvation 
  
6. Sword
____ (a) Knowing that Jesus is the truth protects you from the devil’s lies.
____ (b) Your faith protects or shields you from the devil’s tricks.
____ (c)  Your heart is guarded because you’ve accepted that Jesus has 
made you right with God.
____ (d)  Your mind is protected from doubts and fears because you 
know you are saved.
____ (e)  You are ready to go and share God’s  
peace and the Good News of Jesus. 
____ (f)  You can use God’s Word, the Bible, 
to fight the enemy, the devil.
 38
I have hidden your word in my heart, 
that I might not sin against you.  
I praise you, O Lord;  
teach me your decrees.
Psalm 119:11-12

Dear ______________________________________________________
Well done! And congratulations—you have completed 30 days 
of Bible readings!
We trust that you have learned a lot about God and what it 
means to follow Him and live a Christian life. God has talked to you 
through His Word, the Bible, and you have talked to Him through 
prayer! Isn’t that amazing? You’ve been communicating with God!
It is our prayer that you will continue in your relationship with 
God, your heavenly Father, and that the communication between 
you will not stop now but continue throughout your life. There is 
nothing more important in the whole world!
So may you grow in the Christian faith and always stay 
connected to Jesus, like a vine that produces good fruit.
Remember to put on the whole armor of God every day so that 
you will go God’s way and not your own way, and so that you will be 
able to fight the devil who tries to tempt you to disobey God.
God is a loving God who forgives you when you do wrong and 
are truly sorry. He wants the best for you in life because He loves 
you so much.
May your relationship with the living God become deeper and 
more meaningful every single day.

DAILY BIBLE VERSES
DAY 1 
 John 1:12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become 
children of God, to those who believe in His name.
DAY 2  
 John 3:1-3 There was a man named Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader who 
was a Pharisee. After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. “Rabbi,” 
he said, “we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs 
are evidence that God is with you.” Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, unless you 
are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.”
DAY 3 
 2 Corinthians 5:17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a 
new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
DAY 4 
 Luke 2:52 Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the 
people.
DAY 5 
 1 Peter 2:2-3 Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you 
will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment, now 
 that you have had a taste of the Lord’s kindness.  
2 Timothy 3:14-17 But you must remain faithful to the things you have been 
taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you. 
You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given 
you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus. 
All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make 
us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and 
teaches us to do what is right. God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do 
every good work.
DAY 6 
 Psalm 1:1-3 Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or 
stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. But they delight in the law of 
the Lord, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees planted along the 
riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper 
in all they do.
DAY 7 
  Psalm 119:105 Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.  
Psalm 119:9 How can a young person stay pure? By obeying your word.
DAY 8 
 James 1:22-25 But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. 
 46
Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don’t 
obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. You see yourself, walk away, and 
forget what you look like. But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets 
you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God 
 will bless you for doing it.  
2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what 
is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It straightens us out and 
teaches us to do what is right. It is God’s way of preparing us in every way, fully 
equipped for every good thing God wants us to do.
DAY 9 
 Matthew 6:5-8 When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who love to pray 
publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I 
tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. But when you pray, go 
away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. 
Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you. When you pray, don’t 
babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are 
answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Don’t be like them, 
for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!
DAY 10  Matthew 6:9-13 Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. 
May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. 
Give us today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven 
those who sin against us. And don’t let us yield to temptation, but rescue us from 
the evil one.
DAY 11  Acts 2:42, 46-47 All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, 
and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord’s Supper), and to 
prayer. … They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for 
the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity—all the 
while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the 
Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
DAY 12  Mark 5:19-20 But Jesus said, “No, go home to your friends, and tell them what 
wonderful things the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been.” So 
the man started off to visit the Ten Towns of that region and began to tell 
everyone about the great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was 
amazed at what he told them.
DAY 13  Philippians 4:8 And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your 
 thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and 
admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. 
DAY 14  James 1:26 If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are 
 fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.  
James 3:3-6 We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a 
small bit in its mouth. And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the 
pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong. In the same way, the 
tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. But a tiny spark can set a 
great forest on fire. And the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of 
wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is 
 set on fire by hell itself.  
Psalm 19:14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be 
pleasing to you, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
DAY 15  Mark 12:30-31 “And you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your 
soul, all your mind, and all your strength.” The second is equally important: “Love 
your neighbor as yourself.” No other commandment is greater than these.
DAY 16  John 13:34-35 So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. 
Just as I have loved you, you should love each other. Your love for one another 
will prove to the world that you are my disciples.
DAY 17  Matthew 25:34-40 Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who 
are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the 
creation of the world. For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you 
gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home. I was 
naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in 
prison, and you visited me.” Then these righteous ones will reply, “Lord, when 
did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to 
drink? Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing? 
When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?” And the King will say, 
“I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and 
sisters, you were doing it to me!”
DAY 18  Acts 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And 
you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, 
throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
47
 DAY 19  John 14:26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative—that 
is, the Holy Spirit—he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything 
 I have told you.  
John 15:26 But I will send you the Advocate—the Spirit of truth. He will come to 
you from the Father and will testify all about me.
DAY 20  John 15:5 Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and 
 I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.  
Galatians 5:22-23 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, 
joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-
control. There is no law against these things!
DAY 21  Galatians 5:24-26 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and 
desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there. Since we are 
living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives. Let 
us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.
DAY 22  1 Corinthians 12:4-11 There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same 
Spirit is the source of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve 
the same Lord. God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the 
work in all of us. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. 
To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same 
Spirit gives a message of special knowledge. The same Spirit gives great faith to 
another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. He gives 
one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. 
He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit 
of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in 
unknown languages, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being 
said. It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides 
 which gift each person should have.  
Romans 12:6-8 In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain 
things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as 
much faith as God has given you. If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If 
you are a teacher, teach well. If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. 
If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the 
responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do 
it gladly.

DAY 23  Luke 15:11-19 To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story: “A man 
had two sons. The younger son told his father, ‘I want my share of your estate 
now before you die.’ So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons. 
A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a 
distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living. About the time his 
money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve. He 
persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed 
the pigs. The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding 
the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything. When he finally 
came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘At home even the hired servants have 
food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger! I will go home to my father 
and say, “Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer 
worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant.” ‘
DAY 24  Luke 15:20-24 So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long 
way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his 
son, embraced him, and kissed him. His son said to him, “Father, I have sinned 
against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your 
son.” But his father said to the servants, “Quick! Bring the finest robe in the 
house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet. And kill 
the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast, for this son of 
mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.” 
So the party began. 
DAY 25  Matthew 4:1-4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be 
tempted there by the devil. For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became 
very hungry. During that time the devil came and said to him, “If you are the Son 
of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” But Jesus told him, “No! 
The Scriptures say, ‘People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that 
comes from the mouth of God.’”
DAY 26  Matthew 4:5-7 Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest 
point of the Temple, and said, “If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the 
Scriptures say, ‘He will order his angels to protect you. And they will hold you up 
with their hands so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.’” Jesus responded, 
 “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’”  
Matthew 4:8-11 Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and 
showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. “I will give it all to you,” 
he said, “if you will kneel down and worship me.” “Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus 
 50
told him. “For the Scriptures say, ‘You must worship the Lord your God and serve 
only him.’” Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.
DAY 27  1 Peter 1:7 These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as 
fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere 
gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you 
much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the 
 whole world.  
James 1:2-4 Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it 
an opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your 
endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully 
developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.
DAY 28  Philippians 4:6-7 Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell 
God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience 
God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard 
your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.
DAY 29  1 Corinthians 9:24-27 Don’t you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one 
person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. 
They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I 
run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I discipline my body 
like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after 
preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
DAY 30  Ephesians 6:10-18 A final word: Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 
Put on all of God’s armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all 
strategies of the devil. For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, 
but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers 
in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. Therefore, put 
on every piece of God’s armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time 
of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm. Stand your ground, 
putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God’s righteousness. For 
shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully 
prepared. In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery 
arrows of the devil. Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the 
Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every 
occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.
