TAKEAWAY:  “You should love your neighbor as yourself -- and all 
people are our neighbors.”
A “starving” Chris is looking forward to a pizza, when the kids 
see a girl and her little brother taking all the ketchup packets 
from the pizza parlor to make “ketchup soup.” Joy is concerned 
that the girl and her brother may have nothing to eat.  Chris 
doesn't think it's their responsibility to get involved. SUPERBOOK 
takes the kids back to a town on the road to Jerusalem. Gizmo 
becomes separated from Chris and Joy and is drawn to the village 
well, where Jesus and the disciples have paused to rest on their 
way to Jerusalem. Gizmo hears Jesus begin telling the parable of 
the Good Samaritan… Later, Gizmo finds Chris and Joy at the 
village's marketplace, where Chris, bereft of his pizza, is 
learning what it means to be hungry amid plenty.  Excited by his 
encounter with Jesus, Gizmo leads them back to the well, only to 
find that Jesus and his disciples are no longer there. Gizmo tells 
Chris and Joy the story he heard, and we see the parable unfold as 
Jesus told it -- despite an excited Gizmo's comically unsuccessful 
attempts to put himself into the retelling of the parable. The 
kids are trying to understand exactly what the parable means when 
Jesus returns to the well and helps them understand the meaning. 
The kids return to the modern world, and the kids, following the 
example of the Good Samaritan, invite the girl and her little 
brother to share their pizza.

FADE IN:
EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - ACROSS FROM SCHOOL - DAY (PRESENT)
CRANING DOWN the front of the storefront pizza parlor.
CHRIS (V.O.)
Hey, guys, we have exactly enough 
money to get a pizza with every 
topping! 
INT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
CLOSE ON Chris, Joy, and Gizmo are at the counter.  Unseen 
for now, TOMMY and BILLY are with them. Two kids are also 
standing at a condiment counter, nearby: a girl Joy’s age, 
SAMANTHA, and her six-year-old brother, TRAVIS. 
GIZMO
Excellent Chris!  Pizza is my 
favorite food!
Chris, Joy, Tommy and Billy turn and look at Gizmo.
JOY
Gizmo, robots can’t eat pizza.
CHRIS
Or... like anything.
GIZMO
I am not going to eat it - I’m 
going to admire its shape.
His faceplate projects a circle in the air.
 GIZMO (CONT’D)
A circle is the perfect geometric 
form. (Sigh) Ahhh geometry.  The 
only place where pi is squared.
WIDEN THE ANGLE 
Tommy and Billy grab take-out drink holders with drinks in 
them as the PIZZA PARLOR MANAGER steps INTO THE SHOT behind 
the counter and slides a pizza off a long handled pizza peel, 
right into a waiting pizza box.
TOMMY
I got the drinks.  We’ll see you at 
the park. 
CHRIS
We’ll get the pie and be right 
behind you!  
CAMERA TRACK THEM AND THE TRACK STOPS AT SAMANTHA AND TRAVIS 
as Tommy and Billy exit the shop.
Samantha looks around and sees the Manager is busy closing 
Chris’ pizza box. She quickly picks up handful of ketchup 
packets from the condiment table and quickly turns for the 
door.
SAMANTHA
Come on, Travis.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Chris is taking the pizza box off the counter. Joy notes 
Samantha leaving and calls out...
JOY
See you, Samantha.
Samantha and Travis exit, without answering.  Chris looks at 
Joy, who seems puzzled.
CHRIS
(sarcastically)
Best friend for life, huh?
JOY
We just had a class together once. 
(lowering her voice)
She was... different.  Kind of a 
loner, you know?

 She watches them walk past outside the window (Heading to the 
right)  The Manager passes on his way to the condiment 
counter. 
MANAGER
That girl and her brother come in 
all the time and never order a 
thing.  
ON THE CONDIMENT TABLE
The Manager ENTERS THE SHOT.  He picks up the bowl that held 
the ketchup and turns it upside down -- and nothing falls 
out. He shakes his head.
MANAGER (CONT’D)
But whenever they leave... my 
ketchup’s always gone.
He drops the bowl and opens the cupboard below to refill it.
CUT TO:
EXT. PIZZA PARLOR - DAY (PRESENT DAY)
ANGLE ON THE ENTRANCE as Chris, Joy, and Gizmo walk out.
JOY
Why do you think Samantha would 
take all that ketchup?
CHRIS
Hey -- you said she was 
“different.”  Come on, let’s get to 
the park and dig into this pizza!
Chris and Gizmo start off but Joy sees Samantha and Travis 
crossing the street over to the houses down the block - the 
other direction. (To the right of school)
JOY
Chris... Look. There they are.
Joy starts in their direction.
ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
Chris throws up his arms.
CHRIS
Aw, Joy, come on!  Where are you 
going?

 GIZMO
According to my thermal heat 
sensor, your pizza is losing one 
degree a minute.
CHRIS
Jo-oy. The pizza’s getting cold.
He starts after her.  Gizmo pops the pizza in his chest 
compartment and follows Chris.
EXT. HOUSES TO THE RIGHT OF SCHOOL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
In the distance, SAMANTHA AND TRAVIS go up the steps of a 
small, somewhat rundown house. Grass is a bit more overgrown 
the the others.  Drapes are closed. Joy, Chris, and Gizmo 
hurry PAST THE CAMERA AND INTO THE SHOT, heading toward the 
house.
CHRIS
What are you doing?  
JOY
I don’t know.  Maybe... I don’t 
know.  I’ll meet you at the park if 
you want.
She continues O.C.  Chris and Gizmo hurry after her.
WIPE TO:
EXT. SAMANTHA’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
TIGHT ON A DOORBELL BUTTON as Joy’s hand presses the button -- 
but we don’t hear anything.
ANGLE ON JOY, GIZMO, CHRIS
Joy pushes the button again, a couple of times. Gizmo 
<DEPLOYS> a very large microphone, aimed at the door.
GIZMO
Joy, I do not detect the sound of a 
doorbell. Perhaps it is broken.
Joy <KNOCKS> as Chris looks around.
CHRIS
It looks like the house is broken.
They wait.  No one answers.

 JOY
Maybe they’re out back.
She heads around the house.
SIDE OF SAMANTHA’S HOUSE 
Joy heads past a KITCHEN window and suddenly stops short at 
something she sees inside.  
JOY (CONT’D)
[GASP]
CHRIS
(sotto)
Joy, what are you doing.
JOY
Chris... what are they doing?
Gizmo pulls up and all three kids peek in to see...
POV - THE SMANTHA’S KITCHEN
SAMANTHA AND TRAVIS at a kitchen table that has two water 
glasses and two small soup bowls. The house looks poor. They 
are finishing <SQUEEZNG> the last of the packets of ketchup 
into a pot with water in it.  
JOY (CONT’D)
She did take all the  ketchup!
Samantha gets up and takes the pot to the stove.  She puts it 
on the cook top (No flame - futuristic heat pad)  Then she 
goes to the bread drawer and takes out a half a roll.  She 
breaks it in half again and places one half in front of 
Travis and places the other at her table seat.  
GIZMO
It appears they are using the 
ketchup to make some sort of... 
soup.
Samantha opens the old refrigerator and takes out a pitcher 
of water.  The rest of the fridge is empty.
JOY (O.C.)
Yeah, and it looks like that’s all 
they have to eat.
PUSH IN ON CHRIS JOY AND GIZMO

The kids look at one another.
GIZMO
We could invite them to have pizza 
with us.
CHRIS
Wait what about Tommy and Bill. 
There’s not enough to go around.
JOY
Chris!
CHRIS
I’m just sayin’ the guys are 
waiting and there’s only enough for 
two slices each. - Besides, it’s 
not like you really know her, Joy. 
It’s not our problem.
He starts away. <THE SUPERBOOK SOUND EFFECT> is heard. They 
react -- 
CLOSE UP ON SUPERBOOK as it arcs INTO FRAME.  
JOY, CHRIS, GIZMO (O.C.)
Superbook!
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO
They turn toward Superbook as the SUPERBOOK LIGHT EFFECT

CUT TO:
EXT: THRESHING AREA - DAY
*
We see a town in the distance.  Bundles of barley are in 
*
piles.  A big heap of grain is piled up, and a FARMER has 
*
just turned his back to pick up a wooden rake or pitch fork 
*
(Please use whatever is accurate for this setting.  All 
*
that’s important is that it have  along pole that can 
*
threaten the kids.) Chris, Joy, and Gizmo fall INTO THE SHOT - *

TIGHT ANGLE ON THE FARMER
Turning as he hears the <WHOMP!> of the kids landing in his 
grain -- just in time to get a face-full of flying grain.
FARMER
[SPUTTERING]
WIDER - INCLUDING CHRIS AND JOY
Sitting on the heap of grain (we can’t see Gizmo), with the 
Farmer staggering back, wiping his face --

 FARMER (CONT’D)
[SPUTTERING] What are you doing -- 
jumping in my grain?!
He brandishes the tool angrily. Joy and Chris react with 
*
alarm --
JOY
Come on, Chris!
-- and scramble off the threshing floor, running away towards *
the direction of town.  The farmer shouts after them...
*
FARMER
*
I’ll make you jump!
He runs after them
*
DISSOLVE TO:
*
EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY - A SHORT WHILE LATER
*
ON A CORNER - Chris and Joy run around the corner, ducking 
out of sight. Then Chris looks around.
*
CHRIS
(out of breath)
Joy!  Where’s Gizmo?
Joy leans out for a look.
*
JOY
*
We’d better go back and find him.
*
Chris sees something and reacts with excitement.
*
CHRIS
Awright!  Food court!
ANGLE SHIFT TO INCLUDE A MARKET - Stalls display assorted 
*
wares: pottery, cloth, metal goods -- but also food. Chris 
hurries PAST THE CAMERA AND INTO THE SHOT, with Joy 
following.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
If I can’t have my pizza, let’s see 
what I can get to eat.

 EXT. THRESHING AREA - DAY

the Farmer walks up, still looking around resentfully, with 
*
the threshing tool over his shoulder. He buries it deep into 
*
the heap of grain, right where we saw Gizmo -- <CHUNK!>.
CUT TO:

DOWN THE STREET - ON GIZMO - now walking along, looking for 
*
Chris and Joy.
GIZMO
Chris and Joy must be around here 
somewhere.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN WELL - DAY
Gizmo approaches the group of men at the well.  There is a 
low wall near the well. 
LAWYER (O.C.)
Teacher, what shall I do to inherit 
eternal life? (Luke 10:25 NKJV)
ANOTHER ANGLE ON GIZMO - FROM BEHIND 
We can’t see Jesus because of the crowd around Him.
JESUS (O.C.)
What is written in the law? What is 
your reading of it? (Luke 10:26 
NKJV)
ON LAWYER, MEMBERS OF THE CROWD
At the back of the group of people. The “LAWYER” is a 
Pharisee.
LAWYER
‘You shall love the Lord your God 
with all your heart, with all your 
soul --
ON GIZMO - FROM BEHIND
He’s now standing at the back of the crowd, unable to see 
over. His neck TELESCOPES --

9.
 LAWYER (O.C.) (CONT’D)
-- with all your strength, and with 
all your mind.’ (Luke 10:27 NKJV)
ON LAWYER, MEMBERS OF THE CROWD
Gizmo’s head rises up into view behind them. 
LAWYER (CONT’D)
And you should love your --
(he hesitates)
The Lawyer senses Gizmo behind him. He looks over his 
shoulder -- and Gizmo ducks down out of sight just as the 
Lawyer turns. Seeing nothing, the Lawyer continues:
LAWYER (CONT’D)
You should love your neighbor as 
yourself.
ANGLE ON JESUS
Sitting on a low wall near the well, with several DISCIPLES 
sitting around Him. He nods, pleased by the answer.
JESUS
You have answered rightly; do this 
and you will live. (Luke 10:28 
NKJV)
ON THE LAWYER
CRANING DOWN as he speaks --
LAWYER
But, Teacher -- who is my neighbor?
-- to reveal Gizmo, slipping unnoticed between members of the 
crowd to get a look at Jesus.
CLOSE ON JESUS
JESUS
I will tell you.
WIDE ON THE GROUP
The crowd listens as Jesus begins a parable:
JESUS (CONT’D)
A Jewish man was traveling from 
Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he 
was attacked by bandits. - (Luke 
10:30 NLT)
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13 
10.
 CLOSE ON GIZMO
PUSHING IN on his face as he listens raptly, as if Jesus is 
speaking directly to him.  Gizmo gasps... caught up in the 
story...
GIZMO
(Gasp)
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SECOND TOWN STREET - DAY
ON A CORNER - as Gizmo walks into view slowly, thinking about 
what he just heard. He looks back, as if he doesn’t want to 
tear himself away -- but then he decides that he has to tell 
Chris and Joy. He runs off, PAST THE CAMERA AND OUT OF THE 
SHOT.
GIZMO
I must find Chris and Joy and tell 
them what I have heard!
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN MARKET - DAY
PANNING PAST BREAD displayed on a table at a baker’s stall, 
to reveal Chris and Joy standing outside the stall, looking 
at the bread.
CHRIS
[SNIFFING THE AIR -- THEN A SIGH] 
It kinda smells like pizza.
WIDER ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY 
Including the shrewd and unsympathetic BAKER -- who <SWATS> 
the table, near the displayed bread, with a fly-whisk made of 
a palm frond. The sound startles Chris and Joy, who jump 
back. 
CHRIS & JOY
[STARTLED GASPS]
BAKER
Flies are like children. When they 
pester you --
He <SWATS> the table again.

 CHRIS
Excuse me, sir -- but do you have 
like an odd job we could do to earn 
a little --
BAKER
(interrupting)
No jobs.
CHRIS
Do you ever give away like a free 
sample --
The Baker <SWATS> the table again.
BAKER
No beggars.
TRACKING CHRIS AND JOY
As they walk away, with Chris looking hungrily at a market 
stall laden with bowls of lentils, gourds, and heaps of 
cucumbers, onions, and garlic.
CHRIS
If I don’t get something to eat 
soon, I really will starve!
JOY
Chris you know that’s not true.
Chris stops and looks at her.
CHRIS
I’m serious, Joy!
ON CHRIS - VEGETABLES IN THE FG
Chris looks at the table, comically horrified.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I’m so hungry, I’m starting to 
drool looking at vegetables!
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY
Chris looks at Joy.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I might be delirious!
Joy rolls her eyes.

 GIZMO (O.C.)
Oh, Chris!  Joy!  There you are!
They turn as Gizmo hurries INTO THE SHOT.
JOY
Where have you been, Giz?
GIZMO
I was over at the well listening to 
Jesus!
Chris reacts with excitement.
CHRIS
Jesus?  Awright!  Joy, this must be 
why Superbook brought us here!
Chris and Gizmo hurry away, OUT OF THE SHOT. Joy shrugs 
helplessly and follows them.
WIPE TO:
EXT. TOWN WELL - DAY
ON A CORNER as Gizmo, Chris, and Joy hurry around the corner 
of a building -- and stop, staring.
CHRIS
Where is He, Giz?
LOOKING PAST THE WELL
At Gizmo, Chris, and Joy: they’re the only people around.
GIZMO
I do not know.  He must have left 
right after telling His story.
CHRIS
Oh, man, I am never going to get 
home to eat my pizza!
Joy and Gizmo look at him.
JOY
Do you know what they do with a 
pizza if you leave on the table 
uneaten. 
ON CHRIS

 CHRIS
They probably throw it in the 
trash!  It’s inhuman!
WIDEN THE ANGLE to include Joy.  Gizmo steps eagerly INTO THE 
SHOT.
GIZMO
Guys, will you please stop talking 
about food and listen to me!  Jesus 
told this amazing story!  
PUSHING IN ON GIZMO
As he begins telling the story.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
There was this man, and he was 
walking all the way from Jerusalem 
to Jericho.
RIPPLE DISSOLVE 
TO:
EXT. ROAD TO JERICHO - DAY (PARABLE)
WIDE ON A TRAVELER walking through a wilderness, on a road 
through steep, rocky hills with a few trees. He carries a 
walking staff and has a traveling bag slung over his 
shoulder. CAMERA PANS to reveal three ROBBERS in the FG, 
hiding behind a boulder near the road, waiting for the 
Traveler. They’re all young men (early twenties), and their 
clothes are somewhat tattered, suggesting that they’re poor 
and desperate.
GIZMO (V.O.)
But some robbers were waiting along 
the road to rob people, because -- 
well, because they were robbers.
ANGLE ON THE TRAVELER
Walking along, as he reaches the large boulder. 
GIZMO (V.O.)
Suddenly they attacked the 
traveler!
The three Robbers rush out from behind the boulder.
ROBBERS

 The Traveler reacts with alarm --
TRAVELER
[FRIGHTENED CRY]
-- and turns and flees, with the Robbers closing on him.
GIZMO (V.O.)
It was a good thing there was a 
heroic robot nearby.
UPSHOT ON A ROCKY SLOPE
Gizmo flies up into view from behind a boulder, using the 
<ROCKETS> in his feet, and strikes an absurdly heroic pose. 
There’s a <HEROIC MUSIC STING>. 
GIZMO
I will save the day!
TRAVELER (O.C.)
(a distant cry)
Help!
Gizmo flies down toward the road, maintaining a heroic pose 
even as he flies.
TRACKING GIZMO
As he flies down the slope, skimming the ground, weaving past 
boulders, propelled by his <ROCKETS>.
GIZMO (V.O.)
That when the robot swooped down to 
rescue the traveler and --
CHRIS & JOY (V.O.)
Wait a minute!/ Hold it/ Hold 
on!/Gizmo!
Gizmo looks back as he flies along, as if reacting -- and 
<SMASHES> into a boulder.

 TRACKING GIZMO 
As he <ROCKETS> along, looking back at them --
GIZMO
What?
-- and one of his feet catches in the rope hanging from the 
beam over the well. The rope wraps around the beam, 
<WHIRLING> Gizmo around the beam in a tighter and tighter 
circle....
GIZMO (CONT’D)
WHAAAAOOOOO!!!
Gizmo is finally left hanging upside down from the beam. The 
<ROCKETS SPUTTER AND DIE>.
GIZMO AND CHRIS & JOY
Chris and Joy look up at Gizmo.
JOY
That is NOT the story the way Jesus 
told it.  
CHRIS
Jesus didn’t tell a story about 
you, did he, Giz?
GIZMO
Uh... No. Why?
JOY
So you aren’t in the story.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
GIZMO
Well, technically --
(a long pause)
No.
BACK TO THE GROUP
CHRIS
Stop wasting time, Giz. Just tell 
us what really happened.
JOY
The way Jesus told it. 
Gizmo pulls himself upright and starts untangling the rope.

 GIZMO
All right.  Al right.  But I SHOULD 
have been in the story.

GIZMO (CONT’D)
Jesus said the man was traveling 
along when three robbers attcaked 
him...
RIPPLE DISSOLVE

ground hard.

[A FRIGHTENED GASP]
He looks back, terrified.

[A FAINT GROAN]
GIZMO (V.O.)
They even stole his clothes.
UPSHOT ON THE SUN
Glaring down, suggesting time passing -- and the Traveler’s 
suffering.
GIZMO (V.O.)
And then, after a while, a priest 
came by - and you would think HE 
would help the man!
WIDE ON TRAVELER AND THE PRIEST
The PRIEST (a Pharisee) hurries past, crossing to the far 
side of the road from the injured Traveler, looking around 
nervously.
GIZMO (V.O.)
But he did not stop and he did not 
help the poor man.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN WELL - DAY
GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY - FAVORING CHRIS - as Gizmo tells the 
story.
JOY
How could he just walk by and not 
help?
CHRIS
Maybe he was afraid he might get 
robbed too.
JOY
He still... could’ve helped... 
somehow. Couldn’t he?
Chris reacts, troubled.

avoid him. CAMERA PANS to reveal Gizmo standing on a hill in 
the FG, watching.
GIZMO
I will not going to let him get 
away with that!

Wait a minute!/Giz!
TIGHT ANGLE ON GIZMO’S FOOT
As he steps on a loose stone, and it slips out from under his 
foot --

DOWNSHOT WIDE ON THE ROAD, deserted in both directions, with 
the Traveler a tiny figure lying beside the road, alone.
GIZMO (V.O.)
He was a Samaritan.
Gizmo’s head telescopes up INTO THE SHOT and spins completely 
around, looking in all directions.
GIZMO
And -- I do not see him.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
Long-range lenses <DEPLOY> in front of the eyes on his face

GIZMO (CONT’D)
He must be in this story somewhere.
GIZMO’S POV - THROUGH THE LENSES
ZOOMING IN RAPIDLY, as if through binoculars, and PANNING 
across the barren landscape -- until unexpectedly we END PAN

RAPIDLY to reveal that the eyes belong to one of the Robbers. 
He throws a rock straight AT THE CAMERA.

Suddenly the courageous robot was 
attacked by robbers.
He strikes a martial arts pose.
ANGLE ON GIZMO
As the first robber reaches him. Gizmo does a quick move 
GIZMO
[MARTIAL ARTS CRY]
-- and flips the robber over his head and OUT OF THE SHOT.
ANOTHER ANGLE ON GIZMO
As the robber with the staff swings it at him -- and Gizmo 
<SHATTERS> the staff with a karate chop.
GIZMO (CONT’D)

[YET ANOTHER MARTIAL ARTS CRY]
Gizmo does a series of martial arts moves -- and <SPINS> 
himself off his feet and tumbles over the edge of the well --
GIZMO (CONT’D)
[STARTLED YELP]
WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING CHRIS AND JOY
As they react with alarm --
JOY
Giz!
-- and lunge for the well, grabbing him just before he falls 
in.
Chris and Joy pull Gizmo out of the well.
TIGHTER ANGLE - CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO
Chris and Joy pull Gizmo back from the well.
CHRIS
Let’s get this straight once and 
for all.
JOY
Jesus told a story about a traveler 
who was robbed and no one stopped 
to help him.
GIZMO
Yes.
CHRIS
And you were not IN the story Jesus 
told.
GIZMO
Technically...
CHRIS
At all... not anywhere in the 
story... even remotely.
GIZMO
No. But...
JOY
No buts, Gizmo.  
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13 
22.
 CHRIS
Just tell us what Jesus said 
happened when the next man came 
upon the traveler.
GIZMO
What happened next was a Samaritan 
came along the road.
CHRIS
Good.  And you did not fight with 
any robber because you weren’t in 
the story!
JOY
But the Samaritan... what did he 
do? 
GIZMO
I was having trouble seeing him.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
Figuring it out.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s because I don’t really 
know what a Samaritan is.
BACK TO THE GROUP
CHRIS
(to Joy, complaining)
At this rate, we’re never going to 
get to the end of this story!
GIZMO
Let me check “Samaritan” in my 
database.
CLOSE ON GIZMO
His face screen CHANGES to show information: a pair of MALE 
AND FEMALE SAMARITANS (virtually indistinguishable ethnically 
and in dress from typical Jews), a tiny map with Samaria 
highlighted, written data too tiny to read.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
“Samaritans were inhabitants of 
Samaria similar to the Jews but 
with distinct temples and religious 
customs.”
BACK TO THE GROUP - FAVORING GIZMO
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13 
23.
 His face screen returns to normal, showing his features.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
“Most Jews thought of them as 
foreigners and troublemakers.”
Chris slumps down on the wall.
CHRIS
It would’ve been a lot simpler if 
we could’ve heard all this from 
Jesus! 
GIZMO
I did record video of him telling 
it. 
Chris and Joy look at Gizmo in surprise.
CHRIS
You’ve got video?!
JOY
Why didn’t you say so, Gizmo?
CLOSE ON GIZMO 
His face-screen CHANGES to show HIS POV OF JESUS -- looking 
between two people in the crowd in the FG -- telling the 
parable (the screen also includes a time-stamp and 
measurement bars).
JESUS
A certain Samaritan, as he 
journeyed, came to where the man 
was. (Luke 10:33 NKJV)
RIPPLE DISSOLVE 
TO:
EXT. ROAD TO JERICHO - DAY (PARABLE)
WIDE ON THE TRAVELER AND A SAMARITAN - The SAMARITAN rides a 
donkey along the road, slowly approaching the spot where the 
injured Traveler lies.
JESUS (V.O.)
When he saw him, he had compassion. 
(Luke 10:33 NKJV)
CLOSE ON THE SAMARITAN
He sees the Traveler and reacts, concerned.
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13

 ANGLE ON THE TRAVELER
Lying beside the road. The Samaritan, now on foot, hurries 
INTO THE SHOT, kneels beside him, and gently lifts his head.
JESUS (V.O.)
So he went to him and bandaged his 
wounds, pouring on oil and wine. 
(Luke 10:34 NKJV)
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. INN - NIGHT (PARABLE)
WIDE ON THE SAMARITAN AND THE TRAVELER - The Samaritan is 
leading the donkey, with the Traveler, still weak and groggy, 
riding. Traveler’s wounds are bandaged, and he’s wearing a 
light tunic -- a spare garment provided by the Samaritan.  
JESUS (V.O.)
And he set him on his own animal, 
brought him to an inn, and took 
care of him. (Luke 10:34 NKJV)
INT. INN: A ROOM IN A HOME? - SUNRISE (PARABLE)
PANNING FROM A WINDOW with the morning sun streaming through, 
to reveal the Traveler lying in bed.
EXT. INN - SUNRISE (PARABLE)
THE SAMARITAN AND THE INNKEEPER - The Samaritan stands beside 
his donkey, ready to leave.
JESUS (V.O.)
On the next day, when he departed, 
he took out two coins and gave them 
to the innkeeper. (Luke 10:35 NKJV)
The Samaritan places the coins in the Innkeeper’s hand.
SAMARITAN (NKJV)
Take care of him; and whatever more 
you spend, when I come again, I 
will repay you.
‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will 
reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’CEV

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TOWN WELL - DAY
GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY - FAVORING GIZMO - playing the VIDEO OF 
JESUS on his face screen.
JESUS 
So which --
The video <BLIPS> out abruptly, leaving Gizmo’s face screen 
black.
CHRIS
“So which” what?
Gizmo’s features return to his face screen.
JOY
What happened to the video, Gizmo?
GIZMO
Oh!  That is when I went to find 
you.
Chris stands up.
CHRIS
Oh -- great! 
CAMERA PANS with him as he walks a few steps away, frustrated 
and upset -- and we see Jesus standing nearby, watching them, 
with some of the Disciples behind Him. (Some of the Disciples 
have walking sticks or travel bags -- they’re about to 
continue their journey.)
CHRIS (CONT’D)
We’ve heard the story, but now 
we’ll never know what it means!
THEIR POV - SLIGHT UPSHOT ON JESUS
He smiles.
JESUS
I met a man who knew the word of 
God’s law: to love your neighbor as 
yourself.

 Listening.
JESUS (O.C.) (CONT’D)
Yet he asked me, who was his 
neighbor?
BACK TO THE GROUP - FAVORING JESUS
JESUS (CONT’D)
Which of the three men in the story 
do you think was a neighbor to the 
man who fell among the thieves?
CHRIS
Well... the people from his own 
country wouldn’t even help him...
JOY
So, the one who was a real neighbor 
is the one who helped him.
CHRIS
It was the Samaritan
Jesus lays a hand on Joy’s heads on the kids’ shoulders and 
smiles:
JESUS
Go and do the same.
CLOSE ON CHRIS - PUSHING IN
As he reacts, thinking.
WIDE ON THE GROUP
Jesus walks away, heading out of town. The Disciples follow 
him.
CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO - FAVORING CHRIS
Watching as Jesus and the Disciples walk away.
Joy and Gizmo look at him -- and the SUPERBOOK GLOW appears 
around them, and they are whisked away.
SUPERBOOK WIPE 
TO:
EXT. SIDE OF SAMANTHA’S  HOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)
The kids land back down near the kitchen window.  They look 
in and Samantha and Travis aren’t there.
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13 
27.
 JOY
Chris, they’re gone.
SAMANTHA (O.S.)
What are you doing?
The kids whirl.  Samantha and Travis have just come around 
the corner of the house and come to a stop.
GIZMO
Uh... we are... on our way to the 
park.
A pause... Samantha cocks her head, indicating to back away 
from the house.
SAMANTHA
Park’s that way.  
The kids start forward with Gizmo in the lead.
GIZMO
Yes.  You are correct and we were 
just going there.
They stop because they can’t get around Samantha and Travis.  
Travis leans forward and takes a big sniff.
TRAVIS
(sniffing - Gizmo)
You smell good.
Chris and Joy shoot one another a look.  Gizmo pops the pizza 
box from his chest.
GIZMO
Oh!  That is not me.  That is the 
pizza.
He hold the pizza box.  Travis eyes it hungrily.  
Joy eyes Samantha.  
Samantha looks form Travis to Joy and quickly back to Travis.
ON JOY, CHRIS and GIZMO
Joy and Gizmo step forward on either side of Gizmo.
JOY
(tentatively)
Samantha... do you and your brother 
want to come and share our pizza 
with us?
SB #313 Samaritan - Edens/Roche - Prod Draft 4-10-13

 TRAVIS
Really?!
GIZMO
It does not have ketchup but 
it is... (ooof)
Chris elbows Giz to be quiet.
Justin is eyeing the pizza box with wide eyes.  
Samantha’s eyes dart from Joy, to Chris, to her little 
brother.  A beat...
SAMANTH
You saw me take the ketchup. 
A tense beat...
CLOSE ON TRAVIS
He looks from the kids up to his sister and then back again.
TRAVIS
It’s free you know. 
ON JOY
She smiles at him.
JOY
Yeah.  It is.  
(then she looks at 
Samantha)
I just wondered... why?
ON SAMANTHA
SAMANTHA
Now you know.  So?
A tense moment...
ON CHRIS JOY AND GIZMO
CHRIS
So... if you want to have some 
pizza with us, we’d like you to 
come over to the park.
TRAVIS
Can we?  Please?  I’m tired of 
ketchup soup.
A long beat... then Samantha nods without much expression 
change. But Travis takes the cue.

 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
Awright!  Let’s go!  
He grabs Gizmo’s hand and drags him off. (Hear laughter and 
walla from Gizmo and Travis)
TRAVIS (CONT’D)
What kind of pizza is it? I like 
mushrooms and pepperonis!
Joy and Samantha exchange a look. She looks off at the 
kitchen window.
SAMANTHA
Sometimes... when my mom goes to 
work we don’t have much food in the 
house... until she comes home.  
She looks back at Chris and Joy with a “there, I said it 
expression.”
ON CHRIS
CHRIS
Well, maybe you don’t always have 
to stay at home when your mom’s at 
work.
JOY
Maybe you guys could hang out with 
us. 
SAMANTHA
But you don’t even know me.
Chris points down the block away from school.
CHRIS
We live right nearby.  We’re 
practically...
Joy puts a hand out on Chris’ arm without ever taking her 
eyes off Samantha.  This stops Chris and JOy overrides him.
JOY
No.  We are... neighbors.
CAMERA RISES
As they start around the house.  FROM THE HIGHER ANGLE WE see 
them join Gizmo and Travis and all five kids head for the 
park together.
