TAKEAWAY:  “Show mercy and kindness to your enemies/God protects 
us when we are unaware of it.”
Joy is embarrassed by video of her snarfing down food that a girl 
named Barbara has posted on the internet. She tells Chris and 
Gizmo that she plans to get even by posting video of Barb taking a 
humiliating tumble in cheerleading practice and ending up stuck in 
a trash can. As she's about to upload the video, SUPERBOOK takes 
the kids back to the time of the prophet Elisha. The kids witness 
miracles performed by Elisha and narrowly escape harm from Syrian 
soldiers sent to capture the prophet. Chris realizes that the 
power of God protects us at all times, even when we aren't aware 
of danger. And when Elisha temporarily blinds the Syrian soldiers 
and leads them into the hands of the Israelite king, only to 
insist that the king treat his helpless enemies with kindness and 
mercy, Joy compares the prophet's actions with her own desire to 
get revenge on the girl who has wronged her. Back in modern times, 
Joy deletes the embarrassing video of Barbara instead of posting 
it, and the two girls take the first step toward becoming friends.

FADE IN:
EXT. WILDERNESS ON THE WAY TO THE JORDAN RIVER -  AY
(Do NOT use Jericho in the BG) CAMERA FINDS ELIJAH and ELISHA 
walking together. Elijah wears a cloak. (RECORDING NOTE: 
Elijah will be pronounced with a hard “J”.)
ELIJAH
1
What did the prophets tell you in 
Jericho, Elisha?
TRACKING - FAVOR ELISHA
He glances furtively at Elijah, who is not looking at him.  
Elisha looks ahead again as they walk - then musters the 
courage.  
ELISHA
2
Master, they told me that soon you 
would be taken away.
TRACKING - CLOSE ON ELIJAH 
He mulls this over for a beat and then slows to a stop AND WE 
MOVE INTO A TWO SHOT - ELIJAH CONSIDERS ELISHA WHO LOOKS 
DOWNWARD. The silence forces Elisha to finally look up at 
Elijah.  A quietly emotional moment passes between them. 
Elijah turns his head and looks off towards the direction 
they were headed.
ELIJAH
3
The Lord wants me to go to the 
Jordan River... but you must stay 
here. (2 KINGS 2:6 CEV)
ELISHA
4
I swear by the living Lord and by 
your own life that I will never 
leave you! (2 KINGS 2:6 CEV)
Elisha reaches out and holds Elijah’s arm, as though this 
could stop the inevitable.  
 Elijah looks at Elisha for another beat - offers a slight 
smile of understanding - then places his hand on Elisha’s 
hand on his arm - pats it twice and Elisha slowly lets go.  
Elijah turns and walks OUT OF THE SHOT. Elisha takes a beat 
and then follows him, determined.
DOWN SHOT ON ELIJAH AND ELISHA - CAMERA IS FACING AWAY FROM 
THE RIVER 
They walk BENEATH camera on their way to the river. CAMERA 
JIBS to reveal a group of FIFTY PROPHETS, who have stopped at 
a respectful distance behind them. (100 Yards) At the front 
of the group is ELISHA’S SERVANT (Formally referred to as 
GEHAZI in earlier drafts of this script.  Gehazi is NOT this 
servant so the name change was called for.) - Elisha’s 
servant starts forward. The Prophets follow.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT.  THE JORDAN RIVER - AFTERNOON
(Please check historical directions.  Elijah and Elisha have 
left Jericho and are now facing the Jordan River on the 
Jericho side of the Jordan.) We START on the reflection 
Elijah and Elisha in the water. CAMERA TILTS UP as Elijah 
takes off his cloak and steps closer to the edge.
DOWN SHOT ON THE FIFTY PROPHETS - FROM BEHIND - watching from 
fifty yards in the behind E&E. We can see Elijah and Elisha 
beyond, on the bank. 
ELISHA’S SERVANT/PROPHET #1 AND 
5
#2/PROPHETS
(murmuring wallah - Look... “What 
is Elijah doing?... He has stopped 
at the water’s edge. How does he 
plan to cross the Jordan River 
here?  Can you see what they are 
doing? etc...)
CLOSER ON ELIJAH AND ELISHA 
Elijah WHIPS his rolled cloak through the air, striking down 
at the water -- <SPLASH>! 
CLOSE ON THE WATER 
A moving ripple shoots across the river -- power begins to 
build -- rumbling - churning - 
CLOSE ON ELISHA - He reacts in mild surprise.
ON THE RIVER
Slowly, powerfully, the water begins to part <GURGLING AND 
SPLASHING>.
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    2.
 ANGLE ON ELISHA’S SERVANT AND THE FIFTY PROPHETS 
reacting with wonder and awe.
ELISHA’S SERVANT/PROPHET #1 AND 
6
#2/PROPHETS (CONT’D)
(awed ad-libs ... Look!  It is a 
miracle!  He has parted the Jordan 
River!)
ON THE WATER 
A path opens revealing the riverbed with EIGHT FOOT HIGH 
WALLS of water held back on either side.  
ON ELIJAH AND ELISHA
They step off the shore and walk the path created in the 
river. (Elijah carries his cloak over his arm.)
ON THE ELISHA’S SERVANT AND THE FIFTY PROPHETS 
They watch in stunned silence.
CLOSE THE OPPOSITE SHORE OF THE JORDAN RIVER  
Elijah and Elisha step onto shore and O.C.  The path through 
the river closes with a <ROLLING SPLASH>. CAMERA ADJUSTS SO 
WE SEE Elisha’s Servant and 50 Prophets in distance, still on 
the opposite shore.
FAVORING ELISHA 
He turns to Elijah, who is now looking toward the setting 
sun.  A beat...
ELIJAH
7
Elisha, the Lord will soon take me 
away. 
He turns to Elisha
ELIJAH (CONT’D)
8
What can I do for you before that 
happens? (2 KINGS 2:9 CEV)
Elisha kneels before him.
ELISHA
9
Please let a double portion of your 
spirit be upon me. (2 KINGS 2:9 
NKJV)
ON ELIJAH 
He is silhouetted against the setting sun which is slowly 
getting brighter as...
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    3.
 ELIJAH
10
You have asked a hard thing.  
Nevertheless, if you see me when I 
am taken from you, it shall be so 
for you; but if not, it not be 
so.(2 KINGS 2:10 NKJV)
Elijah turns to look up at the sun.
ANGLE ON ELISHA 
He looks up, shielding his eyes with his hand, as the red-
orange SUNSET GLARE steadily grows brighter behind Elijah.
ANGLE ON THE PROPHETS ACROSS THE RIVER
Reacting and looking up, shielding their eyes from a GLARING 
LIGHT.
ELISHA’S SERVANT/PROPHET #1 AND 
11
#2/PROPHETS
(murmurs of surprise wallah - 
GASP... “What is happening?” What 
is it?)
ANGLE ON THE SUN 
Suddenly a CHARIOT and TWO HORSES MADE OF SWIRLING FLAMES 
driven by MICHAEL THE ARCH ANGEL -- swoops out of the glare 
and races down and PAST THE CAMERA. - (DESIGN NOTE: This is 
an important visual.  Please run the concepts for the fiery 
chariot/horses and Michael driving them past Gordon, Ben and 
Erin. -  GR (reply 2-10-13) - According to 2 Kings 2:11, the 
chariot and horses of fire divide Elisha and Elijah and then 
Elijah is taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, not in the 
chariot.  In order to portray the division of Elijah and 
Elisha, I don't think we can have multiple chariots - just 
have one fiery chariot drawn by two fiery horses that swoop 
down between Elisha and Elijah and then a whirlwind takes 
Elijah to heaven. - I don't want... (to) have the 
chariot/horses appear substantial - there has to be a 
spiritual sense here that Elisha is seeing them as a vision.
ON ELIJAH AND ELISHA 
Elisha stumbles back, shielding his face with his raised 
forearm.  Elijah doesn’t waver.
ELISHA
12
(gasp of fear)
THE FIERY CHARIOT 
swoops in and turns tightly around Elijah, passing between 
the two men - dividing them.
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    4.
 ELISHA (CONT’D)
13
(shouting)
Elijah!
ON THE FIFTY PROPHETS 
They fall, prostrate on the ground.
ELISHA’S SERVANT/PROPHET 31 AND 
14
#2/PROPHETS
(surprised and tumultuous ad-libs)
BACK ON ELIJAH  
THE HORSE AND CHARIOT HAVE TURNED INTO A SWIRLING FLAME.  The 
swirling flame becomes a WHIRLWIND OF FIRE -- <HOWLING WIND 
SFX> -- that completely envelops Elijah. 
CLOSE ON ELISHA
shielding his face from the fiery vision O.C.
ELISHA (NKJV 2 KINGS 2:10)
15
(record 3 - use NKJV)
(NKJV) - My father!  My father!  
The chariot of Israel and it’s 
horsemen! 
(ALT) -- CEV - Israel’s cavalry and 
chariots have taken my master away! 
-- (ALT) - NLT -- My father! My 
father! I see the chariots and 
charioteers of Israel!
WIDER ANGLE
The whirlwind of fire <ROARS> up into the sky -- and Elijah 
is gone, with his cloak left behind on the ground.
ON THE STUNNED PROPHETS - ACROSS THE RIVER 
They slowly raise their heads to look.
ON ELISHA 
looking up, as the GLARE of the fiery whirlwind fades, back 
to normal light. Elisha looks down, sees...
ELIJAH’S CLOAK
Elisha walks INTO THE SHOT and picks it up.
DOWN SHOT ON THE WATER 
Elisha’s shadowy reflection moves into view -- a reprise of 
the reflection SHOT earlier, but now Elisha is alone. 
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    5.
 CAMERA TILTS UP to show Elisha standing at the edge of the 
water, holding Elijah’s rolled-up cloak. He raises it and 
<WHIPS> it down against the surface, and water <SPLASH>.  
There is nothing but the ripple of the splash.
ON ELISHA’S SERVANT AND THE FIFTY PROPHETS
They are still on their knees and watch in anticipation.
PROPHET #1 
16
What is he doing?
CLOSE ON ELISHA
His eyes scan the river in anticipation.
ELISHA
17
Where is the Lord God of Elijah?(2 
KINGS 2:14 NKJV)
POV
Suddenly, a moving ripple shoots across the river, and the 
water parts, <GURGLING AND SPLASHING> as a path opens in the 
water (the same as Elijah’s earlier miracle). Elisha starts 
across the riverbed.
ON ELISHA’S SERVANT AND THE FIFTY PROPHETS 
They rise to their feet - exhilarated.  
PROPHET #2
18
The spirit of Elijah rests on 
Elisha! (2 KINGS 2:15 NKJV)
TRACKING ON ELISHA walking out of the “path” through the 
water, which closes with a <SPLASH> behind him. 
The prophets approach and begin bowing before him, some 
falling to their knees with respect.
CLOSE ANGLE ON ELISHA - as he angles, looking into the 
distance. CHANGE THE ANGLE to include what he’s looking at: a 
magnificent sunset, a whole sky of orange and gold.
FADE OUT:
END OF PROLOGUE 
ACT ONE
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    6.
 EXT. BIKE PARKING AREA BEHIND VALLEY VIEW SCHOOL  DAY 
WIDE ON BIKE RACKS  - The dumpster is nearby. CHRIS and GIZMO 
walk INTO THE SHOT. Chris is drinking the last of an 
individual-sized container of milk. 
CHRIS 
19
Check it out, Giz.
Chris <CRUMPLES> the empty milk container, does a pump fake 
and shoots it towards the dumpster, saying... 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
20
A three-pointer!  All day!
TRACKING THE FLYING CONTAINER
It arcs through the air, but overshoots the dumpster and 
falls behind it.
JOY (O.C.)
21
Heeey!
TWO-SHOT
CHRIS AND GIZMO look at each other with a quick look of 
surprise and guilt. 
THE DUMPSTER 
JOY steps out from behind it, holding the container and 
rubbing her head.  Chris and Gizmo ENTER SHOT.
CHRIS
22
Joy?  Why are you hiding behind a 
dumpster?
JOY
23
So nobody’ll see me.
She tosses the containing over her shoulder and into the 
dumpster as she moves to the corner of the building.
GIZMO
24
That is the motive for over ninety 
percent of hiding.
Chris and Gizmo follow her to the corner. 
CHRIS
25
Okay.  And why don’t you want 
anybody to see you?
JOY
26
Because it’s too embarrassing!
Look at this!
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    7.
 She turns away from peering around the corner and holds out 
her cell phone. 
CLOSE ON THE CELL PHONE 
He finger pushes a button and A HOLOGRAPHIC CLOSE-UP IMAGE OF 
JOY projects UP from the screen.  The Joy-holograph stuffs a 
big wedge of birthday cake into her mouth and gets her face 
smeared with icing in the process.
JOY HOLOGRAPH
27
(COMICAL EATING SOUNDS)
JOY, CHRIS, GIZMO
Chris shrugs as he watches the video.
CHRIS
28
(chuckling) Birthday party last 
year -- I dared you to do that. So, 
what’s the big deal?
JOY
29
A girl named Barbara, got this 
video and morphed the cake into a 
bunch of other food... LOOK! 
She holds the phone and it plays the holo-vid again -- only 
now it’s in FAST MOTION and Joy is seen stuffing her face 
with pizza, a doughnut, a hamburger. Food flies everywhere.  
Now there are GRUNTING EATING SOUNDS 
JOY HOLOGRAPH
30
(SPED-UP GRUNTING EATING SOUNDS) 
JOY
31
And last night she uploaded it for 
the whole world to see!  
JOY, CHRIS, GIZMO - Gizmo shoots a beam from his faceplate 
that SCANS the phone as... 
CHRIS
32
Please... Joy, what are the chances 
that would go viral? 
GIZMO
33
My data scanner indicates there are 
already over seventeen thousand 
downloads!
JOY
34
(AN EXASPERATED WHINE)
Joy turns away, and bangs her forehead slowly against the 
dumpster - THUNK-THUNK-THUNK --
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    8.
 JOY (CONT’D)
35
Why me?
TERESA (O.C.)
36
Hey, Joy!
They all turn. 
TERESA (new) AND STUDENT #1 and STUDENT #2 (reuse) are 
putting their bikes in the rack. 
TERESA (CONT’D)
37
You checking the dumpster for 
food?! (giggling)
STUDENT 1 AND STUDENT 2

ON JOY, CHRIS, GIZMO
Joy is fuming mad and goes to work on her cell touch screen.
JOY
40
Ugghhh!  That does it! I am getting 
even with Barbara right now! I have 
video of her too.
Joy holds up her phone. A HOLOGRAPH projects from the screen: 
JOY (CONT’D)
41
Pep Rally practice three weeks ago. 
Barbara was on top of the world! 
The Holograph shows Barbara atop a cheerleader pyramid THREE 
BOYS on the bottom - TWO GIRLS on their shoulders - then 
Barbara at the top, waving pompoms.
BARBARA HOLOGRAPH
42
Gooooooo Team!...
Chris and Gizmo lean in as the Pyramid gets shaky and Barbara 
starts to “windmill” her arms to keep balance.
BARBARA HOLOGRAPH (O.C.) (CONT’D)
43
Goo--oh...oh..whoah!!!
Chris reacts --
CHRIS
44
Whoa!  Epic fail! 
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    9.
 BARBARA HOLOGRAPH
45
(scream)
The two Cheerleaders holding Barbara jump to the ground in 
one direction.  Barbara tumbles the other way and lands on a 
small round trampoline used for jump stunts.
BARBARA HOLOGRAPH (CONT’D)
46
(impact hit and another scream)
Barbara bounces up and shoots off at an angle landing in a 
plastic trash can by the bleachers - bottom in, legs and 
upper torso sticking out. 
BARBARA HOLOGRAPH (CONT’D)
47
(trash can impact efforts) I’m 
stuck! (yelp)
The trash can topples over.
CLOSE ON JOY
She touches “buttons” on the screen. <BEEPING SFX> 
JOY
48
I’m posting this one as 
“Cheerleader Gets Trashed.” 
A Siri-like voice speaks from the phone:
CELL VOICE (V.O.)
49
Ready to post video.
CHRIS
50
Joy... are you sure you should...
CLOSE ANGLE ON JOY - with her finger poised over the screen.
JOY
51
No mercy.
<THE SUPERBOOK SOUND EFFECT> is heard. Joy reacts, looking up 
from the Phone -- 
CLOSE UP ON SUPERBOOK as it arcs INTO FRAME.  
CHRIS, GIZMO (O.C.)
52
Superbook!
JOY
53
No!  Wait!  I gotta chirp everyone 
in school to check out Barabra’s 
videeeoooooooo.
CHRIS/GIZMO
54
(overlapping Joy’s 
“video”)
Whooooaaaa.....
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    10.
 They’re pulled into the light effect.
INT. SUPERBOOK VORTEX - CONTINUOUS
Joy, Chris, Gizmo fly along. 
SUPERBOOK VOICE (V.O.)
55
I am taking you to meet a man who 
did all God asked while showing 
mercy to his enemies.  
CUT TO:
EXT. THE JORDAN RIVER - TREE CUTTING AREA - DAY
Joy, Chris, and Gizmo APPEAR IN THE SB FX a few feet above 
the water and fall in with a <SPLASH>.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
56
(yelps into coughing/splashing - 
enough to carry through)
ELISHA, ELISHA’S SERVANT, prophet #1 and #2 AND SEVERAL 
PROPHETS 
They are working with iron and bronze axes, <CHOPPING> trees 
near the river: they react to the sound of <SPLASHING> BEHIND 
THEM and turn...
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO 
<SPLASHING> toward the bank, with Joy.  Elisha, Elisha’s 
Sevant, and PROPHET #1 and PROPHET #2  hurry INTO THE SHOT, 
with Elisha carrying his (formerly Elijah’s) cloak.
ELISHA
57
Grab my cloak!  
Elisha tosses the end of the cloak like a rope: she grabs it. 
Gizmo and Chris grab onto her.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
58
(efforts and finishing sputtering/ 
breathing hard)
They are pulled safely to shore.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO (CONT’D)
59
(Ad-libbing thank yous.)
ELISHA
60
What are you children doing in the 
river?
Chris and Joy are caught off guard.  Gizmo brightens.
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    11.
 GIZMO
61
Ah... Spoiler Alert. We’re not from 
around here. 
He walks up the bank and passes... Chris is right behind.
CHRIS
62
Probably should have taken a boat. 
But ya know... where’s the 
entertainment value?  
Joy rolls her eyes as she passes, pulling some slime off her 
arm.
JOY
63
They grow on you... like a fungus.  
PUSH IN ON ELISHA’S quizzical reaction.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT.  THE JORDAN RIVER - TREE CUTTING AREA -DAY 
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO - near a fire, having dried off. 
They watch the prophets chopping trees and stacking sticks.  
CHRIS
64
Wow, the Jordan River lumber jack 
club sure is busy today. Wonder 
what they’re going to build.
Elisha approaches have only heard the end of what Chris said.  
ELISHA
65
The prophets are gathering wood to 
build a larger dwelling.  
CHRIS
66
Hey -- we can help.
Elisha’s Servant steps forward, holding up his ax proudly.
ELISHA’S SERVANT
67
But can you swing an ax like this? 
He swings it mightily down into a nearby log. <THUNK>
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO 
Gizmo starts to DEPLOY a telescoping arm --
GIZMO
68
I have a circular saw --
-- but Joy quickly pushes the arm back, hiding it.
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    12.
 JOY
69
(quickly, quietly)
No you don’t.
BACK TO THE GROUP - FAVORING ELISHA 
looking at his Servant, not the kids (no one was looking at 
Gizmo when he started to deploy his saw).
ELISHA
70
We shouldn’t scorn help, however 
small. 
(turning to the kids)
You can begin by gathering reeds, 
for the roof.
Elisha and his Servant start off.
WIPE TO:
UNDERBRUSH ALONG THE RIVER
Distant sound of <AXES CHOPPING>.  A hand parts the foliage, 
and a SYRIAN SCOUT peers out.
CAMERA TRACKS ALONG A STAND BUSHES- as we hear a <SAW WHINE>. 
END TRACKING on JOY (partly visible above the bushes), 
holding a bundle of reeds in her arms -- and the <SAW WHINE 
ENDS>. She doesn’t look happy.
JOY
71
What are you doing, Gizmo?
Gizmo and Chris rise up into view: Gizmo has his circular saw 
deployed, and Chris is holding up a big bundle of reeds.
CHRIS
72
Speed reeding!
Joy walks past them, shaking her head.
ANGLE ON ELISHA’S SERVANT AND PROPHET #1
The Servant watches as the Prophet #1 hefts the ax 
experimentally, getting ready to chop down a tree. Joy and 
Chris walk INTO THE SHOT and drop their bundles of reeds on a 
stack of bundles. The Servant looks at them.
ELISHA’S SERVANT
73
Stand back, children! My friend 
here is trying my ax!
Prophet #1 swings the ax, burying the edge in the tree -- 
<THUNK>! 
PROPHET #1
74
(swing effort)
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    13.
 But when he tries to pull it back for another swing, it’s 
stuck. He pulls once... twice.
PROPHET #1 (CONT’D)
75
(2 pulling efforts - then the 
surprised release)
Suddenly it comes free, swinging back -- and the ax head 
flies off the handle and OUT OF THE SHOT.
ANGLE ON THE RIVER - The ax head <SPLASHES> into the river.
PROPHET #1
looks at the headless ax handle, perplexed.  The Servant 
takes a step toward the Prophet and grabs the ax handle. 
SERVANT
76
Do you know the cost of an iron 
axe?!  
Elisha walks INTO THE SHOT.
ELISHA
77
Is something wrong?
The Prophet #1 shows Elisha the headless ax handle.
PROPHET #1
78
Oh! - Sir, I borrowed this ax... (2 
KINGS 6:5 CEV)
CHRIS
79
He was chopping that tree and the 
ax head just flew into the river. 
Elisha looks at Prophet #1.
ELISHA
80
Where did it fall in? (2 KINGS 6:6 
CEV)
Prophet #1 points to the spot in the river. Elisha picks a 
piece of tree with a small branch sticking off it.  He cuts 
at it with his sword. 
ON GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY
Joy leans in, whispering.
JOY
81
What’s he doing?
Chris shrugs.
WIDER ANGLE
Elisha tosses the stick into the river. 
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    14.
 CLOSE ON THE FLOATING STICK
The stick turns slowly, drifting for a moment. 
ANGLE CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Gizmo whispers.
GIZMO
82
Oh!  The old “toss a stick find an 
axe” routine. - I say they use my 
metal detector. 
He starts to open his chest.  Chris and Joy simultaneously  
push it shut.
CHRIS/GIZMO
83
No!
ANGLE ON THE WATER
Suddenly the stick sinks.  A beat... a beat... then the ax 
head suddenly <POPS> to the surface and floats there.
GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY
staring in open-mouthed surprise.
CHRIS
84
Iron doesn’t float! --- Does it?
ANGLE ON RIVER 
Prophet #1 wades in the water and retrieves the ax head. 
GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY 
approach Elisha’s Servant, who holds the axe handle.
JOY
85
How did he do that?
ELISHA’S SERVANT 
86
Elisha is our leader now.  When 
Elijah left us, God gave my master 
a double portion of Elijah’s power.  
Prophet #1 walks up and hands the Servant the ax head. He 
nods his thanks and slides the head on the handle which he 
holds.
ELISHA’S SERVANT (CONT’D)
87
He has even saved King Jehoram!
JOY
88
Who is King Jehoram?
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    15.
 The Servant slides some small stick wedges into the 
handle/head to secure it.
PROPHET #1
89
He is the King of Israel. 
ANGLE ON THE SYRIAN SCOUT 
hiding amid the reeds, listening.
ELISHA’S SERVANT (O.C.)
90
The Syrians have been raiding our 
land, stealing our grain and 
cattle.
ON ELISHA’S SERVANT - 
ELISHA’S SERVANT (CONT’D)
91
When King Jehoram marched against 
them, they laid an ambush for his 
army.  And Elisha warned the king.
WIDEN TO INCLUDE, GIZMO, CHRIS, JOY - 
ELISHA’S SERVANT (CONT’D)
92
It’s as if my master knows 
everything the Syrian king says, 
even in his own room!
CLOSE ON SYRIAN SCOUT - reacting.
SYRIAN SCOUT 
93
(whispered, to himself)
So that is why our ambush failed.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE WILDERNESS - SYRIAN CAMP EST. SHOT - NIGHT
Dozens of tents and campfires in the distance: the camp of 
the raiding Syrian army. The Syrian Scout trots PAST THE 
CAMERA and INTO THE SHOT, heading for the camp.
WIPE TO:
EXT. IN THE SYRIAN CAMP - NIGHT (A SHORT TIME LATER)
ANGLE ON SYRIAN SCOUT AND THE SYRIAN KING & A SYRIAN CAPTAIN - 
The King sits on a traveling throne (if historically 
appropriate) outside his tent.  The Scout approaches, bowing. 
The scene is lit dramatically by a <CRACKLING> CAMPFIRE.
SYRIAN SCOUT
94
My king, I know who is telling our 
enemies of your plans. 
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    16.
(MORE)
 It is an Israelite named Elisha. He 
is a prophet. He can tell his king 
everything --
ANGLE ON THE KING AND THE SYRIAN CAPTAIN - FAVORING THE KING - 
as he listens, with growing anger.
SYRIAN SCOUT (CONT’D)
95
-- even what you say in your own 
room. (2 KINGS 6:12 CEV)
The King rises.

FIVE DOTHAN SOLDIERS are manning the top of the walls. CAMERA 
TILTS DOWN to reveal a large contingent of SYRIAN SOLDIERS, 
some on foot and many in chariots - outside the wall - facing 
the town, but far enough away to be out of the reach of 
spears or arrows. The Syrian Captain is on horseback.
SYRIAN CAPTAIN

Men of Dothan! Hear my words!
INSIDE DOTHAN CITY WALL - CAMERA IS MOVING WITH ELISHA,

FIERY CHARIOTS circle above the town -- the same type of 
fiery chariot we saw when Elijah was taken away.
UPSHOT ON ELISHA ATOP THE WALL

ELISHA
142
Lord, make those soldiers blind! (2

Strike these people, I pray, with 
blindness!
WIDE
Suddenly the FIERY CHARIOTS IN THE SKY explode like fireworks 
-- (silently - or with a WIND SOUND but NOT explosions) -- 
disintegrating into hundreds of glowing, fiery “sparks” that 
shoot down around the town.
ANGLE ON THE SYRIAN CAPTAIN
One of the “sparks” streaks down INTO THE SHOT and hits him 
in the eyes.  The Captain falls backwards off his horse, 
which shies away, <NEIGHING>.

(STARTLED CRIES AN SCREAMS)
Some stagger back, some fall backwards or fall to their knees 
as “sparks” shoot INTO THE SHOT and hit them in the eyes. 
     Elisha/Syrians - Edens - Rec-Prod Draft 2-10-13    24.
 The Scout turns TOWARD THE CAMERA, blinking -- we can see 
that there’s no physical damage. He reaches out, groping 
blindly. (MAYBE A MILKY FILM LOOK COVERS THE EYES TO MAKE THE 
POINT STRONGER)
SYRIAN SCOUT
145
Captain! What’s happening?!
THE SYRIAN CAPTAIN
He is sitting on the ground, rubbing his eyes with his hands, 
as his horse nuzzles him, <NEIGHING GENTLY>.
SYRIAN SCOUT (O.C.) (CONT’D)
146
I cannot see!
The Captain touches the horse’s head with his hands, feeling 
his way blindly, not looking at it directly.

The horse stops with a WHINNY. The Syrian Captain is alarmed.  
SYRIAN CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
151
Who is there?!... 
(pulling his sword)
Speak or I’ll cut you down!
He looks left and right - unseeing in fear.  Elisha steps 
around the horse and speaks calmly.
ELISHA 
152
(2 KINGS 6:19 NKJV) This is not the 
way, nor is this the city. 
The Captain whirls to face him - still not able to see him.
SYRIAN CAPTAIN
153
(surprised sound)
ELISHA
154
Follow me, and I will bring you to 
the man whom you seek.
The Captain reacts but has no choice.  
Elisha turns and walks to the front of the horse and begins 
to lead it forward.   
IN THE DISTANCE ANGLE ON - ELISHA’S SERVANT, CHRIS, JOY, 
GIZMO
They watch as the long line of soldiers, now led by Elisha, 
snakes towards them - perhaps a half mile away.

159
(gasp) Look!  Elisha is with them!
CLOSE ON ELISHA
He is leading the group.  Chris, Joy, Gizmo and Elisha’s 
Servant walk nearby.  As the line passes camera, the blinded

free hands are “touching space” around them, indicating their 
blindness.
BACK ON KING JEHORAM AND THE THREE SOLDIERS 
KING JEHORAM
