FADE IN:
EXT. JUST ABOVE THE TENT-LINE OF A SYRIAN ARMY CAMP - 
LATE AFTERNOON
A blood red sun sets in a darkening sky. 
CAMERA EASES BACKWARDS OVER THE TENTS AND JIBS DOWN 
through the SMOKE from O.C. campfires.  We HEAR <THE 
CLATTER OF ARMOR - HORSE WHINNIES... A VICTORIOUS ARMY 
RETURNING FROM BATTLE>
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN SOLDIERS (O.C.)
1
(walla)
CAMERA DROPS between a row of tents - PICK UP 12 YEAR OLD 
SERVANT GIRL, in a line of Israelite prisoners.  Their 
hands are bound in front of them but should NOT be tied 
together in a line. (See Erin’s Ref).  She moves along - 
dirty - wary - eyes darting at every sound and motion. 
A woman falls.
WOMAN
2
(scream)
She is yanked up by Syrian Raider #2
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #2 
3
GET UP!  MOVE ALONG!  FASTER!
Then the Servant Girl falls.  
SERVANT GIRL
4
(gasp and falling effort)
 LOW ANGLE - <FRIGHTENING WHINNIES> - Horse feet stomp 
past, dangerously close to the fallen child, as mud 
splatters.
SERVANT GIRL
5
(screams)
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #1 (O.C.
6
Hahaha. I’ll take this little 
Israelite with me! (pulling 
efforts)
A massive, ham-size fist explodes down INTO FRAME, grabs 
the Servant Girl by her still-rope-wrapped wrists, and 
yanks her upwards. 
SERVANT GIRL
7
(gasp-yelp)
CLOSE ON RAIDER #1 - pulling the Girl up to his face.
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #1
8
She’ll make a fine servant to 
bring me my wine skins! - Small 
enough not to be seen or heard! 
(Nasty laugh)
The Servant Girl doesn’t flinch.  Held up in front of the 
Raider’s face, she stares straight into his eyes.
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #2 (O.C.)
9
You don’t deserve a servant!  I’ll 
take her off your hands! 
RAIDER #2 reaches INTO SHOT and grabs the girl‘s 
shoulders, tugging her sharply. QUICKLY WIDEN as...
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #1/#2
SERVANT GIRL
Suddenly, Raider #2 is violently yanked O.C. by an unseen 
force. 
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #2
10
AGGGHHH!
Raider #1, still has control of the Servant Girl. But he 
freezes and looks O.C. past the girl he holds up in front 
of him. She can’t see who the Raider is looking at behind 
her, but he visibly weakens as he hears...
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         2
 NAAMAN (O.C.)
11
Let her go.
A BEAT - A STRONG FOREARM reaches INTO FRAME and slowly 
wraps around the girl - carefully - easing her from the 
Raider’s clutches.  As the Raider releases...
SYRIAN/ARAMEAN RAIDER #1
12
Commander...
EXTREME CLOSE ON THE SERVANT GIRL’S FACE
We only see Naaman’s breastplate behind her as she’s 
eased from harm’s way. The girl’s eyes are wide... they 
slowly look downward... as the CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS, EVER 
SO SLIGHTLY, TO REVEAL what she sees - the strong forearm 
that holds her protectively. 
NAAMAN (O.C.)
13
Now go back to your men.  
The girl’s eyes slowly angle upwards and out at the O.C. 
Raider.
ON RAIDER #2
He hesitates - backs away - then turns and runs off.
ON SERVANT GIRL
Naaman reaches down and cuts the rope around her wrists.  
SERVANT GIRL’S POV 
NAAMAN (O.C.)
14
Come with me.  
LOW - ANGLE BEHIND THEM
His body turns to go.  The Servant Girl watches him 
intently.  A beat as she reads him - then...
ON NAAMAN
He looks down at her.
NAAMAN
15
You’ll be safe. 
He walks away into the army camp.

 ON SERVANT GIRL
She rises - looks around and thinks of fleeing - but 
realizes it’s impossible to escape.  She follows Naaman

FADE IN:
EXT. QUANTUM YARD - DAY
Chris is at the picnic table working on a small remote 
controlled hover-plane with a screw driver.  
Joy sits on the opposite bench, back against the table, 
texting madly on her phone. 
Gizmo zips out from the house carrying a circular.  
GIZMO
16
Chris!  Chris, all of the newest 
Holo-9 games are coming online 
this morning!   
He zips up to the table and comes to an abrupt stop.
GIZMO
17
And we must hurry because there 
are only a limited number of 
downloads available for... wait 
for it... wait for it... Zombies 
of The Apocalypse!
He holds up the print-out.  No Text - but some comical 
Zombies with laser disks flying and exploding around them 
and slime rockets passing through dispensing slime 
antidote.  There is a scannable code in the corner. Chris 
starts patting himself down.
CHRIS
18
My phone!  My phone!  My phone!  
Agh! Joy, I gotta borrow your 
phone!
He launches over the table - grabs her phone - and races 
back towards Gizmo.
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         4
 JOY
19
Chris!  I was texting the Girl’s  
Volunteers Club! 
GIZMO
20
Yes, and that is much more 
important than saving the world 
from scavenging hoards of slime 
sucking zombies.  
Chris scans the ad. 
GIZMO
21
Oh! And the first 100 to register 
also receive a dozen scary, Zombie 
Ring Tones.
Chris stares at the phone.
CHRIS
22
Agh!  No way!
Joy zips in and tries to grab the phone from him.
JOY
23
Yes, way!  Now gimme!
He turns to keep her from getting it.
CHRIS
24
I mean, no way!  Giz and I just 
scored 1000 Free Anti-Rot Power 
Points if we download the game in 
the next 5 minutes!
She grabs the phone back.
JOY
25
Dream on, Chris!  (grab effort - 
getting phone) - Your parents 
don’t allow you to play Zombies of 
the Apocalypse.
(pushing button - 
DELETE SFX)
Scan deleted.
She goes back to her mad texting.
FAVOR CHRIS AND GIZMO
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         5
 Chris looks a bit dejected as he and Giz stare at the 
printout, wistfully..
CHRIS
26
Ungh... Joy’s right.
GIZMO
27
Yes. It is probably a good thing 
anyway.  I do not know how heroic 
I would actually be if I came face-
to-face with a Zombie. Even if I 
HAD lightning laser discs, super 
slime rockets and 1000 free anti-
rot-power-points.
FAVOR JOY 
She punches away at her texting.
JOY
28
(frustrated gggrrrr..) I’m in 
charge of the Girl’s Volunteer 
Club this semester.
Chris and Gizmo listen.
JOY (CONT’D)
29
So, I’m calling girls to work at 
the Valleyview food pantry on 
Saturday.  
ON JOY
She gets more emphatic. 
JOY (CONT’D)
30
I’ve rounded up donation from over 
100 people. Locked in three local 
supermarkets and two farm stands.  
Then I’m going to make 20 posters 
and take 100 fliers door to door.   
She looks at her phone.
JOY
31
And now there no one to work the 
12:00 shift at the pantry.  
Probably the busiest time all day. 
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         6
 CHRIS
32
Why don’t you just do it?
She throws her hands up.
JOY
33
I am doing everything. This whole 
food drive would fall apart 
without me.  
(looking at the 
phone)
Twelve Noon Shift - no one. 
Grrr...
The Superbook EFFECT comes up.
CHRIS/GIZMO

SUPERBOOK!
Superbook flies INTO FRAME and whisks the kids up.

A blue FLASH as the kids land down inside the house.
INT. NAAMAN’S QUARTER’S - TWILIGHT
The room is lit low with oil lamps. The kids appear in 
the blue light of the SUPERBOOK FX.  They look around, 
quickly, cautiously, speaking low.  There are clothes 
laid out and dressing bandages on the table.

 JOY
37
Guys, we’ve landed inside 
somebody’s house.
CHRIS
38
Giz, get a reading.
Joy and Chris start for a door that is slightly ajar and 
LIT from beyond.
JOY
39
Let’s just get out before we have 
a lot of explaining to do.
ON THE MOVE - Gizmo checks his wrist sensor.  
GIZMO
40
According to my Geo-Sensors we 
have landed in Syria.  And the 
year is approximately 850 BC.
FAVOR CHRIS - He reaches to throw open the door when a 
VOICE comes from the other side.
NAAMAN (O.C.)
41
Servants?  Are you there?
The kids freeze - wide-eyed with fear.  
NAAMAN (O.C.)
42
Bring me the dressings on the 
table.
Gizmo starts shaking with fear.
GIZMO/JOY/CHRIS
43
Ahmumunnununmma...(fearful 
whispered wallah)
The kids freak out. PANIC ZOOM IN ON THEIR FACES.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
44
(screams)
They race OUT OF FRAME.
WHIP PAN TO THEIR POV 
Naaman stands there, bare chested. His body is covered 
with leprous lesions that run all the way up the side of 
his neck. 
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         8
 His face is cut by a dark shadow made by the open door.  
We hear another door in the room open as the kids’ 
SCREAMS depart out into the hall. Naaman steps forward 
into the light.  His kind face is still not affected by 
the leprosy but we now see the full magnitude of the 
disease on his whole body.  It is hard to look at.
NAAMAN
45
Come back!
INT. SERVANT’S QUARTERS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
(This is NOT the same corridor that led from Naaman’s 
room.) - The kids careen around a corner and enter this 
corridor with Gizmo in the lead, hands out in front, and 
eyes wide with fear.

(screams of fear)
GIZMO
47
ZOOOOMMMMMBIIIIEE!!!!
JOY
48
Guys!  In here!
She races into a side room.  
FAVOR CHRIS -
He skids past, stops, turns and scrambles back into the 
room, dragging Gizmo with him. <SLAMMING THE DOOR> in 
sheer panic.
INT. SERVANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Chris, Joy and Gizmo are hunkered down, backs to the

die. Oooaaahh...
They suddenly hear someone approaching the door and leap 
to their feet.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO 
52
(gasps - whispered fear walla)
POV BOTTOM OF DOOR
They see a shadow being cast below the door.
JOY (O.C.)
53

THEIR POV
A shadowy figure stands at the door.  It raises an oil 
lamp and is suddenly visible.  It’s the Servant Girl. She 
see Chris, Joy and Gizmo.
SERVANT GIRL 
56
Oh... Hello.
The kids freeze and turn. ANGLE SHIFTS AS she enters and 
shuts the door.
SERVANT GIRL
57
Are you my master’s new servants?
FAVOR CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO

New here!  We just arrived!
GIZMO
60
(leaning in - sharp - 
under to C&J)
Yes, in the land of Zombies!  
(then aloud)
And now it is time to go! 
ANOTHER ANGLE
Simultaneously, so that we don’t allow the Servant Girl 
to witness it - she turns to gather the garments off the 
table near the door. Meanwhile, Gizmo turns the other 
way, faces a high window - shoots his arm extensions out - 
grabs the lip of the window, and starts climbing the 
wall.  As she answers, gathering up the clothes with her 
back to them, we see Chris and Joy are grabbing at 
Gizmo’s legs and struggling to yank him off the wall.
SERVANT GIRL
61
Do not worry.  You will come to 
like it here.   
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
62
(struggles as Giz tries toe scape 
out the window and C&J stop him)
There is a sudden <CRASH> as Gizmo falls beside Chris and 
Joy.   They try to look innocent as the Servant Girl 
turns to them.   
SERVANT GIRL
63
Naaman and his wife are very kind 
people.
GIZMO
64
But what kind of people?
(speeding) Scary, oozing-bruising-
flaky skin kind of people?
SERVANT GIRL
65
(suddenly low)
You have heard about our master’s 
illness?
GIZMO
66
Heard about it?  We just about got 
SMACKED DOWN IN ZOMBIETOWN!

CLOSE ON SERVANT GIRL
She lowers her head sadly.
SERVANT GIRL
68
My master is a mighty man of 
valor.  A commander in his king’s 
army. And he protected me in a 
time of great danger.
She looks back up at them, approaches and hands them the 
garments.
SERVANT GIRL
69
But now he is being crippled by 
leprosy.  
She turns and heads for the door.
JOY
70
(whispering)
What’s leprosy?
ANGLE ON DOOR
The Servant Girl exits pulling the door after her.
SERVANT GIRL
71
I will be here when you are ready.
BACK ON THE KIDS
GIZMO
72
That is what we saw!  And that 
means Naaman is not a Zombie!  Woo-
hoo!  Infoscanning leprosy. 
ANGLE CLOSE ON GIZMO’S FACEPLATE  
IT SHOWS IMAGES OF LEPROSY.

73
Wow.  He he has this terrible skin 
disease?

And according to my files there is 
no cure for leprosy here in 850 
BC.
SLOW PUSH IN AS Chris and Joy look at one another with 
concern.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. NAAMAN’S QUARTERS’ - TWILIGHT
Naaman sits on a stool by the table that contains his 
wardrobe and the bandages.  NAAMAN’S WIFE stands beside 
him.  His head rests on her hip and she strokes his hair.
NAAMAN
75
My time is short.
NAAMAN’S WIFE
76
Do not speak of such things.  
He lifts his head away from her to look up.
ANGLE - THE DOOR TO NAAMAN’S ROOM 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo now wear servant garments and arrive 
with the Servant Girl.  They see Naaman talking to his 
wife in private and they stop.

men to victory, in countless 
battles for Syria.

NAAMAN
78
Yet, with all my wealth and 
power...
He rises and holds his leprous hands up before himself.
NAAMAN

Naaman’s wife steps INTO FRAME in front of his raised 
hands.  
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         13
 He turns them open and moves them one on either side of 
her face - but he keeps them inches from her skin.
NAAMAN
80
... so that I cannot even touch 
the ones I love. 
Standing there, between the hands, unable to be touched, 
a tear rolls down his wife’s cheek.
CLOSE ON THE SERVANT GIRL
A tear rolls down her cheek in sadness at what she is 
witnessing.
BACK ON NAAMAN AND HIS WIFE
Naaman’s hands tremble, wanting to touch, but refusing 
to.  They lower from frame.  Naaman’s wife turns away and 
dabs at her tear.
NAAMAN’S WIFE
81
(slight sob)
Naaman drops back down onto the seat in dejection.
NAAMAN
82
(effort as he sits)
ANGLE THE DOOR 
They kids stand there in stunned silence for a beat.  
JOY
83
(softly)
I wish there was something we 
could do.
The Servant Girl makes a decision...
SERVANT GIRL
84
Maybe there is. 
She starts forward.
FAVOR NAAMAN
He pulls a cape or some other material/clothing from the 
table to drape over his shoulders, covering himself.

 FAVOR NAAMAN’S WIFE AND THE SERVANT GIRL
The girl leans close and Naaman’s wife bends down so she 
can hear her whispering.
SERVANT GIRL
85
(2 KINGS 5:3 NLT)
If only my master were with the 
prophet who is in Samaria.  For he 
would heal him of his leprosy.                 
Naaman’s wife is taken aback.
NAAMAN’S WIFE
86
What?!  Child...
ON NAAMAN, CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Naaman turns and smiles at the Servant Girl.
NAAMAN
87
What have you said to startle my 
wife?
ON NAAMAN’S WIFE AND THE SERVANT GIRL
NAAMAN’S WIFE
88
She says... 
(looking at Servant 
Girl in disbelief 
then back at Naaman - 
with a tinge of 
hope)
... there is a prophet among her 
people who can heal leprosy.
FAVOR NAAMAN
Naaman slowly walks over to the Servant Girl. He squats 
down so that he can speak to her, face to face.  Her face 
is angled slight downward as he speaks - starting slow 
and low.
NAAMAN
89
My soldiers raided your land and 
took you from your people. Yet, 
when I watch you I am impressed at 
how you serve me, in the face of 
all that has happened to you.

of it)
But do not speak to me of prophets 
and cures in Samaria unless you 
know, without a doubt, that these 
things are real.

Looking back at Naaman. PUSH IN ON HER EYES...

Then, this girl from Israel tells

her people, who can cure lepers!
CAMERA WIDENS TO Naaman and Ben-Hadad. 
BEN-HADAD II
93
The Israelites have been our 
enemies  - still -... 
He turns and sees Naaman, who is now looking worse than 
the last time they met.  He winces and lets out a slight 
gasp.
BEN-HADAD II
94
(gasp-throat clear) - Naaman, you 
are my most trusted general.
He looks at the leprosy on Naaman’s face and then looks 
down his arms. He fills with resolve.
BEN-HADAD II (CONT’D)
95
Let us see if this news is true.  
I will write you a letter to their 
king.  But return in time for the 
celebration our god, Rimmon. 
(turning and exiting 
past Naaman towards 
entrance)
He is a god with power.  
Ben-Had II exits.  Naaman is left alone.  He looks at his 
hands and arms, covered in boils - then looks up at 
Rimmon - nothing - back on Naaman who turns and exits.

 PUSH IN ON NAAMAN as he steps off the chariot - He 
displayes weakness and pain.
NAAMAN

And tell the king I am not used to 
waiting. 
CUT TO:
INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY
KING JORAM hurries along with KING JORAM’S AIDE.  The 
Aide carries the tablet/letter.
KING JORAM
106
(intense - concerned)
I do not understand why the King 
of Syria sent his most important 
commander all this way?!   Is he 
planning an attack?
KING JORAM’S AIDE
107
If you will listen I can...
KING JORAM
108
Does he have soldiers hiding in 
the wilderness, waiting for his 
word to storm our city?
The reach the end of the corridor - The Aide throws open 
the doors of the throne room they move in - swiftly 
passing Naaman’s Aide #1 and #2, Chris, Joy and Gizmo, as 
well as a group of Israelites of the King’s Court.  Among 
those in the court is ELISHA’S SERVANT.   The King 
doesn’t even acknowledge the group.  CAMERA KEEPS MOVING 
with the King and his aide.
KING JORAM’S AIDE
109
He has come with his servants 
bearing great gifts.  
The King finally come to a stop near his throne. The Aide 
finally hands him the tablet.
KING JORAM’S AIDE
110
And he sent this letter.
The King looks back at the Aides, Chris, Joy and Gizmo, 
who stand near the door with the rest of the court.  
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         20
 Then he turns to read the letter.
CLOSE ON KING JORAM
He reads... then becomes angry... and drops the tablet.  
It <SMASHES> on the floor.
KING JORAM
111
(Loud long Cry)
He <TEARS> his outer garment.
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Joy’s eyes fly open.  The kids are taken aback.
CHRIS
112
Is it me or is he overreacting? 
CLOSE ON THE KING
He is livid and repeats what he just read with sarcasm.
KING JORAM
113
(NLT 2 Kings 5:6 )
“With this letter I present my 
servant Naaman. I want you to heal 
him of his leprosy??!”
King Joram whirls and shouts out at the audience.
KING JORAM
114
(NLT 2 Kings 5:)
This man sends me a leper to heal! 
Am I God, that I can give life and 
take it away? 
He whirls back around to his Aide, seething...
KING JORAM
115
I can see that he’s just trying to 
pick a fight with me.
The Aide hurries to pick up the broken pieces of the 
tablet.
KING JORAM’S AIDE
116
It is not a trick!  I have seen 
the man for myself.  
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         21

 He comes to you because you are 
the King and the Prophet Elisha 
lives under your rule.

He has seen enough and quietly slips out of the room and

But Elisha, I am telling you what 
I witnessed with my own eyes and

INT. ELISHA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Elisha rises and walks to the window - peering out for a 
moment - then he turns to Gehazi.
ELISHA
119
You must take this message back to 
the king. 
CAMERA SLOWLY - POWERFULLY MOVES IN ON ELISHA
ELISHA

I’m just saying it could happen.
CHRIS
122
Couldn’t.
GIZMO
123
Could.
CHRIS 
124
Wouldn’t.
GIZMO
125
Might!  IF there were real 
Zombies... 
CHRIS
126
Which there aren’t.
GIZMO
127
But if there were... and if they 
thought... like WE first 
thought... that Naaman was also a 
real Zombie...
CHRIS
128
Which he’s not.
GIZMO
129
But if a Zombie thought he was a 
zombie, Chris - then that Zombie 
would come here and start hanging 
around Naaman. You know how 
Zombie’s always hang around in 
groups.  I don’t know why but they 
do. And pretty soon, mistaken 
identity or not, Naaman’s a Zombie 
magnet. Zombies think he’s a 
zombie and he’s suddenly drawing 
random zombies from all over the 
region. Right here.  Right where 
you and I are trying to sleep.    
CHRIS
130
Good night, Gizmo.
Chris lies down, back to Gizmo. Beat... beat... Blink...

Oh, like you can sleep in the

Zombie Showdown. - (sucking it up) 
Alright!  Looks like I have first

He looks to his side and Joy (waist down) is stepping 
into frame close to him.
JOY
132
BRAAAAINS!
GIZMO
133
ZOMBIE!!!
Gizmo dives head-down into his torso and quakes. 
Simultaneously, Chris sits upright as ANGLE WIDENS TO 
REVEAL IT’S JOY.
CHRIS
134
Hey Joy?
Joy lies down.  Gizmo is between her and Chris.  
JOY
135
Early Zombie Warning System?
CHRIS
136
Teachable moment.  
Gizmo’s head eases out of his Torso.  Chris leans in.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
137
She’s not a Zombie.  Naaman’s not 
a Zombie.  There are no Zombies.  
Go to sleep. 
Chris lies down, back to Gizmo.
GIZMO
138
I’m just saying...
(low)
I still got first watch.  Could 
happen. Stumbling out of the dark,

Good night, Gizmo!
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         24
 He jumps slightly but goes silent, just his eyes dart 
left and right.
CUT TO:
EXT. ELISHA’S DOOR - DAY (2 KINGS 5:9)
CAMERA WIDENS OUT to REVEAL Naaman’s Aide #1 approaches 
the door and knocks.  Naaman approaches displaying 
fatigue and pain.
NAAMAN
140
(painful efforts)
ANGLE NEARBY
Chris, Joy, Gizmo stand by the chariots.  The donkeys, 
laden with packs, are in the BG.
JOY
141
Naaman has carried out the perfect 
plan. 
Chris and Gizmo look to her.
JOY (CONT’D)
142
I mean, look.  We’ve traveled deep 
into his enemy’s territory.  He 
showered their king with gifts - 
and now the king has arranged the 
meeting. It’s going the way it’s 
supposed to.
ANGLE ON NAAMAN AT THE DOOR
The door opens. Elisha’s Servant stands there.
NAAMAN
143
Are you the Prophet Elisha? 
ELISHA’S SERVANT
144
I am his servant. 
CEV 2 Kings 5:10)
The Prophet says, “Go wash seven 
times in the Jordan River. Then 
you'll be completely cured.”
The door closes. Naaman holds for a beat...

 NAAMAN

(fatigued groan)
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They seem stunned.

What?!
BACK ON NAAMAN
He whirls away from the door in frustration.
NAAMAN
147
(frustrated moan)
His Aide 31 moves to him.
AIDE #1
148
Commander...
He reaches out and Naaman flings his arm to keep him 
away.
NAAMAN
149
(load moan)
Naaman storms over to his chariot.
NAAMAN
150
(CEV 2 Kings 5:11)
Why couldn't he come out here and 
talk to me? 
ANGLE NEAR THE CHARIOTS
The kids get out of his way as he charges up.
NAAMAN
151
I thought for sure he would stand 
in front of me and pray to the 
LORD his God, then wave his hand 
over my skin and cure me.
He gets on his chariot and yells back at the front door.
NAAMAN
152
(CEV 2 KINGS 5: 12)
What about the Abana River or the 
Pharpar River? 
       SB 305 - NAAMAN - ROCHE - Anicon Draft Draft 5-5-14         26
(MORE)
 Those rivers in Damascus are just 
as good as any river in Israel. I 
could have washed in them and been 
cured.
He angrily raises his whip and <CRACKS> it.
NAAMAN
153
Yaaaaa!!
His chariot races O.C.
ANGLE ON THE KIDS
CHRIS
154
I don’t get it.  Why wouldn’t 
Elisha come out and see him.
Since Naaman’s Aides #1 & #2 were established near the 
kids.  Three other servants approach, milling about with 
#1 &#2.  Have Chris and Gizmo turn to the servants and be 
interested in what they are saying.  However, we see Joy 
is more concerned with where Naaman stormed off.
SERVANTS
155
(concerned wallah - “Why won’t he 
even try?  The prophet has said 
this can cure him.  I do not 
understand his outburst.  This 
could be the only way.  Why won’t 
he listen?
PUSH IN ON JOY
She looks quickly at the servants and shakes her head 
then hurries off in the direction Naaman exited.  We 
should get the sense she is on Naaman’s wavelength. 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE JORDAN RIVER - SUNSET
Naaman rides up and leaps of his chariot - in pain - he 
stumbles but gets to his feet.

NAAMAN (CONT'D)
 NAAMAN
157
Who does he think he is refusing 
to see ME!  
JOY
158
He has no right to treat you this 
way.  You’re the a commander of 
the Syrian army!  
NAAMAN
159
I’ve come far across the 
mountains!  Brought gifts to his 
king. Yet he refuses to come out 
and even speak o me himself.  
(derisive - down)
Go, wash in this river.  That’s 
his answer to me?! 
ANOTHER ANGLE
Aide #1 and #2 approach.
NAAMAN’S AIDE #1
160
(NLT 2 King 5: 13)
Sir, if the prophet had told you 
to do something very difficult, 
wouldn’t you have done it? 
Naaman looks up at his Aide.
NAAMAN’S AIDE #1 (CONT’D)
161
So you should certainly obey him 
when he says simply, ‘Go and wash 
and be cured!

She looks at him and watches to see his reaction.

He looks at river.

It shimmers in the fading afternoon sunlight.

Naaman getting closer to the river. He stops at the edge 
and looks into the MUDDY WATER.  He looks at his leprous 
hands.
Naaman flashes on the servant girl - the memory of the

He reaches in the cart and takes a hand full of dirt, 
sprinkling it on the ground.  Then the servant girl steps 
up and does the same.  
Naaman turns to his wife.  A beat - she smiles - and does 
the same.  Chris, Joy and Gizmo look on.

they need to go.
GIZMO

But then what about the twelve 
noon spot, Joy?
JOY
191
Maybe God’s trying to tell me 
something, Giz.  If a great
