TAKE AWAY:  God's ultimate forgiveness will save us all
SYNOPSIS:  In a life-altering event, Chris accidentally starts a 
fire that burns down the Quantum family's home.  He believes there 
is no forgiveness for something this big.  However, SUPERBOOK 
takes our heroes on a journey to show them that forgiveness - the 
ultimate forgiveness has always been a part of God's plan for 
mankind.  Chris encounters Satan in the desert just before the 
time of the apocalypse.  As Satan attempts to lure the emotionally 
battered boy over to his side, simultaneously we see Joy and Gizmo 
have landed in heaven where John is recording the revelations 
being shown to him by God.  These events culminate in the 
climactic moments on earth, when God vanquishes Satan and New 
Jerusalem descends upon earth.  All who have asked God's 
forgiveness are granted eternal life in His kingdom.  When 
Superbook returns the kids home, Chris faces his parents who are 
just thankful everyone is safe.  This thing he has done, for which 
he could never be forgiven, IS forgiven by his father, out of his 
love.  Chris and his parents hug joyously and know that their 
house is just a possession that can be replaced.  Chris, for his 
part, has come to learn the true power there is in forgiveness and 
that God has an amazing plan for our salvation.

CHRIS (O.C.)

[pushing effort] You guys could 
*
help at least a little.
The camera COMES AROUND TO REVEAL - Chris is pushing.  JOY 
AND GIZMO are standing nearby.  Joy’s arms are akimbo, and 
she is glowering.
JOY
5
And, may I say again, you probably 
aren’t supposed to be using your 
Dad’s Super-Surge Power Generator!
WIDE ON THE SHOP - as Chris stops and moves around the 
machine.  He pulls a cord from the side of the unit and 
inserts it into a household vacuum cleaner as...
CHRIS

Hey, Mom said to clean the house 
before she comes home.  
Chris starts <FLIPPING SWITCHES>.  A <HUM> fills the air.
CHRIS (CONT’D)

(raising voice over the 
rising hum)
And with enough power, this vacuum 
will suck up a whole house full of 
dust faster than you can say spring 
cleaning!
CLOSE ON THE SWITCH/MONITOR PANEL - A needle rides over into 
the red zone.
BACK ON JOY AND GIZMO - Joy and Giz cover their ears as the 
AMP-UP CRESCENDOS.
JOY

Gizmo, order him to turn that thing 
off!
GIZMO
9
I’m in charge?  That’s great!
Gizmo spins; when he stops, he is wearing a soccer uniform, 
holing a whistle and raising a yellow card.  
GIZMO (CONT’D)

Dangerous action! Penalty!

I’ll turn him back on as soon as 
I’m done.
He throws the last switch on the generator, and -
CLOSE ON GENERATOR - as huge flames BURST FROM THE MACHINE 
with a loud <EXPLOSION>!
CLOSE ON CHRIS AND JOY - their faces lit with the glow of the 
burning machine.

Giz, FIIIIRE!!
The glow of the flames reflects off of Gizmo’s shocked face 
plate.
GIZMO
18
Do not panic, Joy!
He wraps an arm around Joy, lifts her and zooms out-
JOY
19
CHRIIIIIS!
ON CHRIS - standing, still shell shocked. The flames 
refection plays off his face. Gizmo zooms INTO FRAME, wraps 
his arm around Chris.
GIZMO
20
Chris, we must get out!  NOW!
He zooms O.C. with Chris in his arms.
CHRIS
21
Whoaaa!!!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. QUANTUM HOUSE - MUCH LATER
A Fire Truck is visible.  TWO FIRE FIGHTERS (One male and one 
female) are dousing the last of the smoke with a hose from 
the tanker truck. 
PAN TO FIND Chris, Joy and Gizmo standing silhouetted against 
the burnt out ruins of the house.  
Chris bends down.  From the edge of the burned out rubble he 
picks up a charred HI-TECH CUBE about the size of a small 
children’s building lock.  
CLOSE ON THE HI-TECH CAMERA CUBE

 Chris brushes away some soot. It GLOWS to life. (THIS IS A 
CAMERA CUBE USED TO STORE VIDEO AND PHOTOS)  On the cube we 
watch a video clip of Chris’ reaction the day he got his Holo-
Station 4... (REUSE FOOTAGE FROM EPISODE #102) -Then is 
starts pixilate as frozen images of Chris and his mom and dad 
pass in a broken up slide-show format.  Then it freezes on a 
picture of Chris and his mom and dad standing outside their 
house. 
ANGLE RISES FROM THE CUBE UP TO CHRIS -
He’s looking down at it remorsefully. Joy’s hand lands softly 
on Chris’ shoulder, as she moves in slightly behind Chris.
JOY
22
Chris, it’ll be okay, once we-
Chris spins on her, lashing out.
CHRIS
23
It’s not gonna be okay, Joy!  It’s 
*
never gonna be okay!

Gizmo looks defeated.
GIZMO
24
(SIGH) - What are we going to tell 
your parents? 
CHRIS
25
It doesn’t matter.  I’ll never be 
forgiven for this.  Never.
<SUPERBOOK SOUND EFFECT>
WIDE ON THE TRIO - A GLOW emanates from the burnt out house.
CHRIS, JOY & GIZMO
26
Superbook!
The rubble of the house shakes, <BRICKS FALL> as-
CLOSE ON SUPERBOOK - rising from house, glowing brightly.  
The book opens-

 They are pulled into Superbook with the SUPERBOOK FX.
INT. SUPERBOOK TUNNEL - CONTINUOS
The kids and Gizmo travel down the tunnel.
SUPERBOOK
28
There is nothing that cannot be 
forgiven. Take heed. Listen well. 
The time is short.
EXT. DESERT FIELD - DAY
SUPERBOOK EFFECT - Chris lands in a dark, desert field - 
desolate - alone. 
CHRIS
29
(landing sound effort) -  Where are 
we now, Gizmo?  Joy?
WIDE SHOT - there is no one else in sight.
A SHADOW falls across Chris, as if a flying man with wings 
was landing behind him -- which is exactly what is happening.  
The shadow is all bulk and jutting angles, more like the 
shadow of a gargoyle. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS
His eyes go wide as he sees the shadow on the ground around 
him.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
30
<GASP>
He twirls -
ANGLE ARCS DRAMATICALLY AROUND TO REVEAL... SATAN IN HIS 
LUCIFER GUISE - no hint of the leathery face, or dark 
features.  He is a beautiful, majestic angel and he settles 
down before Chris.  
CHRIS (CONT’D)
31
Are you... an angel?
SATAN
32
Yes, in fact I am.
Chris kneels, his head bowed.

Hmmm, I like this one.  
(back to Chris)
*
Tell me, who are you, and what are 
you doing out here?
CHRIS
35
My name is Chris.  Superbook 
brought me.
ON SATAN - his eyes flaring, his face suddenly harsh, angry, 
demonic.
ON CHRIS - who hasn’t seen the change.  He turns and sits, 
suddenly shamed.
TWO SHOT - Satan has reverted to his beautiful form.
SATAN
36
Hold on, I can sense it.  You’ve 
*
disappointed God.  You’ve done 
*
something.  
Chris suddenly stands and walks at an angle to the 
foreground.  He stops as Satan calls out.
SATAN (CONT’D)
37
I know how you feel.  I once did 
something... bad.
Chris stops, but doesn’t turn back.
CHRIS
38
Really?  What happened to you?
Chris looks to Satan.  Satan considers him - then goes nose 
to nose with Chris.
SATAN
39
You are right, my son.  There is no 
forgiveness for the likes of us.
Satan straightens, and puts his hand on Chris’ shoulder.
SATAN (CONT’D)
40
But it will be okay.  You’re not 
alone.  You have me now.
CONTINUE PULL BACK AND OUT.

 INT. OUTSIDE THE THRONE ROOM - DAY
A vast room -- marble floor, rows of columns so high they 
extend out of sight.  The room is empty. SUPERBOOK EFFECT 
lands Joy and Gizmo in the middle of this room. GIZMO - he 
holds his stomach.
GIZMO/JOY
41
(landing efforts)
GIZMO
42
Ohh... I just cannot get used to 
that thing. 
Joy looks around.  
JOY
43
Giz, where’s Chris?
GIZMO
44
Why he’s right...
He looks around; no Chris.  Joy and Gizmo make eye contact, 
then turn out:
JOY & GIZMO 
45
(panicked)
Chris!
They start towards a large balcony that is visible through an 
archway.
ON THE MOVE - Gizmo does a scan but his visor readout spews 
gibberish.
JOY (O.C.)
46
He shouldn’t be alone, not now.
EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING HEAVEN  - CONTINUOUS
They scurry outside - Gizmo pops his wrist chronometer up 
from his wrist unit and is eyeing it, still on the move.
GIZMO
47
Uh, Joy?  Chris isn’t the only one 
lost. 
(checking his chronometer)
My Chronometer is still indicating 
we are outside of time and space.
Joy STEPS INTO SHOT to have a closer look.
JOY
48
Is it broken?

 JOHN (O.S.)
49
He is correct.
Joy and Gizmo turn to see: WIDEN TO INCLUDE JOHN - the 
apostle.  He carries a scroll and a quill pen.  
GIZMO’S FACE RECOGNITION SCAN TURNS ON IN HIS FACEPLATE
GIZMO
50
My face recognition scanner 
indicates you are John, the friend 
of Jesus!
JOY
51
John, have you seen our friend 
Chris?  We got separated.
JOHN
52
I am sorry. I have not.
ON GIZMO
He is pulling a screw driver from his now-open chest plate 
and works on the dangling ear piece as...
GIZMO
53
I do not suppose your sensors are 
working well enough to know where 
and when we are?
FAVOR JOHN
JOHN
54
We are outside the throne room of 
Heaven, at the end of time.

JOY AND GIZMO - as their eyes go wide.
JOY
55
Throne room of Heaven?

JOHN
56
Yes.  I am here to bear witness to 
the end of days, when Jesus will 
return and set the world right.
John moves a few steps away and looks off the balcony - into 
the distance. 
JOHN (CONT’D)
57
I have already witnessed such 
amazing things.

JOY
58
John, why are you being shown  
these things?
John holds up his quill.
JOHN
59
I am to record my visions of the 
future, for the benefit of all 
mankind.
CLOSE ON QUILL - Gizmo’s face suddenly pops up behind the 
quill.
GIZMO
60
Oooh, is that an original stylus 
*
one point zero?  Classic!
ON GIZMO’S CHEST - Gizmo’s hand opens the chest plate and 
pulls out a very fancy, metallic quill.
ON JOHN AND GIZMO
Gizmo holds up his quill.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
61
Personally, I prefer the Waterboy 
Quill Three Thousand Electric 
Stylus.  It can write in zero 
gravity, underwater, inside a vat 
of jello-
Joy pushes in between the two.
JOY
62
Excuse me, but we have more 
important things to deal with.
GIZMO
63
More important than the Waterboy 
Electric Stylus?
FAVOR JOY
JOY
64
Yes.  Like, where is Chris?
ZOOM INTO THE BLACK OF HER CONCERNED EYES, AND...
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:
EXT. FIELD
CLOSE ON CHRIS’ CAMERA CUBE -  It is playing the same cycle 
of images we saw in act one.  ANGLE WIDENS OUT. Satan stands 
with his hand on Chris’ shoulder.
Lucifer reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the cube from him.
CHRIS
65
Hey...!
Satan holds the cube high and looks up at it.
SATAN
66
It’s not your fault that things 
went bad. 
Chris jumps to try to grab it from him. 
CHRIS
67
(jump effort) - Yes it is.
Satan gives him a look then flips the cube to him. 
SATAN
68
(sinister snicker)

 Chris catches it as...
SATAN (CONT’D)
69
No.  Creation’s corrupt.  
It is God’s fault.
CHRIS
70
It’s God’s fault?
SATAN
71
That’s right.  No matter how hard 
you and I try to make this world 
better, bad things still happen.  
Things go wrong.
Satan spreads his magnificent wings and an ENERGY FLOWS FORTH 
MORPHING THE SURROUNDS -  The desert-scape is replaced by a 
new location.

cruelty and abuse.
Satan spreads his magnificent wings again.  THE SURROUNDS 
MORPH ONCE MORE. Now Chris and Satan are standing...

The PHILISTINE ARMY (from “A Giant Adventure”) stands, 
raising their spears, <SHOUTING>. 10 SOLDIERS

SATAN (V.O.)
And as much as you or I want 
peace, there is always war.
The Philistine Army MORPHS into A FLANK OF 10 SOLDIERS IN A 
MODERN DAY ARMY with ND UNIFORMS, holding rifles instead of 
spears.
Satan morphs them back to the desert setting.
END OF MONTAGE
INT. FIELD - DAY
ON CHRIS, the reflection of the Army in his eyes fade as...
CHRIS
74
But that’s people. They make those 
choices.  That isn’t what God does!
SATAN 
75
Isn’t that worse?  God designs the 
world so that it punishes the 
innocent for the mistakes of 
others.

76
No.  God...
(thinking about his 
predicament - hoping)
God... forgives.  
SATAN
77
Forgiveness?  Pfft... Words!  There 
*
is no forgiveness.  If God really 
wanted mankind to be at peace with 
him, and with one another, do you 
think there would be sickness and 
death?
Satan turns to a pool of water and waves his hand.  The water 
ripples and Chris looks to see...

smoldering.
SATAN (CONT’D)
82
Is that fair?  No.  We are not the

problem.  At least we try to be 
good.  The problem, as you can 
plainly see, is God Himself.
Chris thinks about this. Could Satan be right?

You shouldn’t care so much about

Sadly, they seem to be part of the

No... I know who you are.
Chris twirls to face Satan.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
114
You’re Satan, the evil one, the 
devil!  
ON SATAN - his face twists in anger.  His whole body flashes 
for a brief second -- reptilian wings, dark features, a 
twisted face.  But he manages to hold onto his splendid 
Lucifer visage.
SATAN
115
Eat the fruit!  Free yourself!
ON CHRIS
CHRIS
116
No! I did something wrong.  And I 
would rather take punishment from 
those that love me than run from it 
and be with you!

 SATAN
117
You weak minded fool!
Lucifer finally loses his composure and thus loses his hold 
on his Lucifer visage. He turns into FULL-FORM SATAN - THE 
FRUIT in his hand turns black and shrivels up.
SATAN (CONT’D)
118
Rather be punished by those that 
love you?  No one loves you. That’s 
why you’re all alone here!  YOU...

SATAN

SATAN - Satan stretches back and transforms into a giant 
SERPENT!  This is the serpent/snake from the Creation

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
THE SON OF GOD - in white robes. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - He sits on a WHITE HORSE.

 Balls of fire hit the ground, creating <EXPLOSIONS> among the 
scattering army.
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - <EXPLOSIONS> and the <SCREAMS> of 
the Army are still all around them as they run.  A SWORD 
smashes into the ground and they stop short.
GIZMO
149
Quick, both of you under me.  I’ll 
protect you.

But Gizmo, that’s brave!

 Gizmo points to the sky.
GIZMO
161
Look!
EXT. THE SKY - DAY
NEW JERUSALEM EFFECT
<GRAND MUSIC> underscores throughout.
Shafts of light fill the sky, like lasers emanating from a 
bright point - perhaps a star.  The bright point is moving 
toward the earth.  We hear the VOICE of Superbook.
SUPERBOOK
162
Behold, the tabernacle of God is 
with men, and he will dwell with 
them, and they shall be his people.
As the light gets closer, the beams increase -- a rainbow of 
light shafts, shooting like laser beams from the heart of... 
well, we can’t quite make out what it is.  It looks like a 
jagged city of crystal -- like Superman’s Fortress of 
Solitude hurling through space.  But imagine that Fortress 
with the heart of a star in the middle...
As it moves closer, it leaves a long, rainbow trail of light, 
akin to a comet’s tail.
SUPERBOOK (CONT’D)
163
God Himself will be with them and 
be their God.
The object slows, and rotates above the scorched out ground.  
The rays of the object bathes the ground, and the earth 
changes colors to a healthy green.
MONTAGE:

first.  Then begins to walk with a look of pure joy.
IMAGE:  An OLD MAN, bent over a cane, haggard and broken.
The image TRANSFORMS, as the man becomes young before our 
eyes, straightening and standing tall.
IMAGE:  Two CHILDREN, skin and bones.  
The image TRANSFORMS, as the two children move into action, 
no longer gaunt, joining hands and spinning joyously.

more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
END OF MONTAGE.
EXT. THE SKY - CONTINUOUS
The object is clearer now -- it is a walled city, but one 
made of gold-hued crystal.  Majestic in its spires, with a 
light radiating from the inside that makes the translucent 
walls shimmer.  
The city spins, allowing all sides to be seen.  The spinning 
slows.
SUPERBOOK
165
There shall be no more pain, for 
the former things have passed away.  
Behold, God makes all things new.
The city slowly descends and settles. WE SEE THE CITY IN FULL

EXT. NEW JERUSALEM STREET - (INTERIOR OF CITY OF HEAVEN) - 
DAY
TRACKING AS - Chris, Joy, Gizmo and John walk down a broad 
street made of gold.  
CAMERA PANS THE BUILDINGS - The city glows, which still makes 
the buildings of gold and jewels around them a bit 
indistinct.  The street they follow runs along a tree-lined, 
rushing river. There are perhaps waterfalls and natural 
elemenets mixed in with the building structures.

 EXT. THRONE OF NEW JERUSALEM
FROM A LOW ANGLE - A large throne, eighty feet high, 
towering, emanating light.  The seat of the throne is not 
seen due to the light.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - The river comes from here -- a 
waterfall cascading down from the throne.
PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW - Chris, Joy, Gizmo and John at the 
base of the throne, staring up.
ON THEIR FACES - radiating pure joy.
SUPERBOOK
168
(softly)
And there shall be no more curse, 
but the throne of God and of the 
Lamb shall be in it.

CAMERA PANS UP FROM THE BASE OF THE THRONE - Up, up, up to 
the seat of the throne -- the source of the light.  
The glow is too bright to see the figure on the throne very 
clearly.  Is it a Lamb?  The figure, the source of the light, 
seems now one, now the other. (THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EFFECT) 
It changes -- and Jesus is sitting where the lamb was.
ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO AND JOHN - they kneel.
<SUPERBOOK SOUND EFFECT>
Chris, Joy and Gizmo are pulled away in the SUPERBOOK EFFECT, 
as John stays kneeling.
<END OF MUSIC>
EXT. QUANTUM HOUSE - DAY
The burnt out rubble that used to be the Quantum house 
(again, reminiscent of the burnt out post-battle field). The 
Superbook Effect lands Chris, Joy and Gizmo in front of the 
house.

Whoa, I forgot about this.
