                           "King Solomon"
Episode # 311
Take-Away:  Ask God to give you wisdom and guide you in your 
decisions. 
LOG LINE:  After his father leaves him in charge of an important 
project, Chris faces a challenge he never imagined. When he is 
unsure of how to handle the situation, Superbook takes the kids 
back to ancient Jerusalem where they meet King Solomon. There, 
Solomon encourages Chris to share his burdens with the Lord and to 
pray for wisdom and guidance from Him.  Chris is encouraged and 
inspired when he is able to witness, firsthand, Solomon taking his 
own advice to overcome the greatest challenge of his young reign 
using wisdom the Lord has given him. With that, the kids return 
home, and Chris, having sought guidance from the Lord, is able to 
solve the challenge that previously seemed impossible and 
hopeless.

FADE IN:
EXT. STARRY SKY - NIGHT
CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE... DOWN THROUGH CLOUDS 
TOWARDS TO THE, EARTH... AND THE MIDDLE EAST... 
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GIBEON - NIGHT 
CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the HOUSE where Solomon is staying. 
(Erin’s Ref) We HEAR praying.
SOLOMON (O.C.)
(praying - low mumbling) 
INT. SOLOMON’S QUARTER’S GIBEON - CONTINUOUS
CAMERA FINDS SOLOMON on his knees - arms raised and eyes 
closed. His lips are moving but his VOICE is barely audible. 
Several LIGHTED OIL LAMPS illuminate the room. THE CAMERA 
JIBS DOWN AND BEGINS TO CIRCLE THE KNEELING SOLOMON.
GOD (1 KINGS 3:5 CEV)(OC)
Solomon...
Solomon stops praying and slowly opens his eyes.  Then his 
eyes dart, looking around.
GOD (CONT’D)
... ask for anything you want, and 
I will give it to you.
Solomon’s eyes soften. He lowers his hands to his breast and 
dips his head in reverence.
 SOLOMON (1 KINGS 3:6-9 CEV)
My father, David, your servant, was 
honest and did what you commanded. - 
you've made me king in my father's 
place. 
EXTREME CLOSE ON SOLOMON’S EYES
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
But I'm very young and know so 
little about being a leader. -
He slowly raises his head and looks towards Heaven.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Please make me wise and teach me 
the difference between right and 
wrong. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - Solomon raises his hands in prayer.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
If you don't, there is no way I 
could rule this great nation of 
yours.
The room begins to GLOW. LIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM ABOVE.
GOD (1 KINGS 3:10-14 CEV)(OC)
Solomon, I'm pleased that you asked 
for this. - you asked for wisdom to 
make right decisions. 
CLOSE ON SOLOMON
He lowers his arms but his head is angled up to the light.
GOD (CONT’D)
So I'll make you wiser than anyone 
who has ever lived or ever will 
live. -I’ll also give you what you 
didn’t ask for. You’ll be rich and 
respected as long as you live, and 
you’ll be greater than any other 
king. 
ZOOM IN FAST ON SOLOMON’S EYE.  There is  FLASH THAT BLURS 
INTO A CLOSED EYELID THAT OPENS, A PUPIL DILATES... CAMERA 
PULLS OUT TO REVEAL A NEWLY AWAKENED SOLOMON.
SOLOMON
(gasp!)
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 2.
 ANGLE CONTINUES TO WIDEN  - revealing we are still in the 
room.  Only one lamp is now lit.  Solomon has been sleeping 
and sits up abruptly. He is almost shaking.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
A dream. The Lord God has visited 
me in a dream!
FADE OUT.
ACT ONE
FADE IN:
EXT. CITYSCAPE NEAR VALLEYVIEW MUSEUM - EVENING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - Rain beats down on the city. LIGHTNING 
FLASHES. <DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLES> 
CAMERA PUSHES TOWARD THE VALLEYVIEW MUSEUM’S GLASS DOMED 
ATRIUM.  The sky illuminates with LIGHTNING. Through the rain 
smeared glass we make out the silhouette of a giant, ominous 
looking creature.  <EXPLOSION OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING> 
INT. VALLEY VIEW MUSEUM ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS 
The camera jumps inside the dome and we are face to face with 
a giant TRANSFORMER-STYLE ROBOT DISPLAY. (Like a dinosaur 
display  would anchor a natural history museum atrium) 
<LIGHTNING FLASH AND THUNDER CLASP>.  CAMERA SLOWS AND TRACKS 
DOWN the Giant Robot in the WELL LIGHTED museum atrium. 
STUDENTS (O.C.)
(excited/helping wallah)
As CAMERA DESCENDS we get a bird’s-eye view of activity 
below. TEN STUDENTS, dressed in Valley View school uniforms, 
scurry about like worker bees. - (PLEASE REUSE EXISTING 
STUDENTS AND MAKE THE GROUP ETHNICALLY DIVERSE) - Several 
archways lead off the atrium into other halls of the museum.  
Prominent are two particular archway entrances. There is a 
display space of about 30 feet between the archways.  This 
space is where most of the action will take place. There is a 
series of PRISTINE WHITE LIGHTED ARCHITECTURAL COLUMNS all 
around the atrium - part of the museum infrastructure - which 
will be used in a later piece of business.  One archway 
entrance has a large SIGN depicting a spider and snakes, 
indicating the entry to the Natural History Hall. Above the 
other is a large SIGN depicting rocket ships, a space 
station, and circling planets. (Signs need to be large enough 
to read instantly because they a Set-Up for later piece of 
business) 
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 3.
 BOY STUDENT #1 and GIRL STUDENT #1 carry boxes across the 
atrium.  BOY STUDENT #2 and GIRL STUDENT #2 are on two step 
ladders hanging a banner over the 30 foot space between the 
two archway entrances.  The banner has a large smiling faces 
of PROFESSOR QUANTUM on each end. In between his photos is a 
string of high tech math and science equations and symbols - 
more decorative than practical.  Below the banner BOY STUDENT 
#3 and GIRL STUDENT #3 are straightening the table cloth and 
skirt on a large display table. On the table is a stainless 
steel pedestal (empty) with a pin-spotlight directed down at 
it.
To one side, BOY STUDENT #4 arranges a larger than life size 
cardboard cut out of Professor Quantum, posed, holding up a 
beaker, checking its florescent, glowing contents.  One the 
other side of the display table GIRL STUDENT #4 arranges 3 
posters on easels. Each of three posters depict Professor 
Quantum in some heroic, scientific pose. #1 Quantum is 
wearing the jet pack, helmet and goggles, while hovering 
above Chris, Phoebe and Gizmo in the Quantum backyard.  #2 He 
is posed by the well from Ep #207.  His massive water 
filtration system is running and a geyser of water is roaring 
up from the well.  #3 Quantum is wearing the EXO-SKELETON 
SUIT from Ep #304 while holding Chris and Gizmo aloft, one on 
each forklift arm.
GIZMO is at one of three portable display cases, (Part of the 
Quantum Display) containing circuit boards and high-tech 
looking electronics.  Gizmo is polishing the case with his 
BUFFER ATTACHMENT. (This particular display is situated 
beside one of the WHITE LIGHTED ARCHITECTURAL COLUMNS.)
TRACKING WITH PROFESSOR QUANTUM, JOY AND CARSON
Quantum is carrying the MAG-SYS.  It’s a small 4”X4” silver 
and red electronic box with a few electrical connectors. Joy 
walks alongside with a clipboard. CARSON, a science nerd, 
with braces, walks on the other side, as they head for the 
display table.
JOY
Wow!  So, that one little invention 
makes most of your other inventions 
possible, Professor Quantum?
Prof Quantum holds the MAG-SYS up proudly.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
That’s correct, Joy. 
ANGLE ACROSS THE STEEL PEDESTAL ON DISPLAY TABLE TO QUANTUM
The Professor leans in placing the Mag-Sys on the pedestal.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 4.
 PROFESSOR QUANTUM (CONT’D)
When I invented the MAGNETIC GYRO-
CAPACITOR SELF SUSTAINING ENERGY 
STABILIZING SYSTEM...
Joy and Carson each lean INTO SHOT from either side.  
CARSON
(cutting him off)
... or MAG-SYS for short!
Quantum turns his head and gives a brief pause over Carson’s 
interruption. Carson beams at him, braces FLASHING in the 
spot light.  Quantum catches himself... 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Er... exactly... That’s when I knew 
I had a breakthrough!
ANOTHER ANGLE
Professor, Joy and Carson stand upright. Carson grabs 
Quantum’s hand, pumping it with too much gusto.
CARSON
Professor Quantum, thank you for 
letting our science class get a 
sneak peek.  Why, just spending 
these fleeting moments in your 
presence is a lifelong dream come 
true.  And I’m only 12!
Professor Quantum extricates his hand with a chuckle.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Hehe... Uh, my pleasure, Carson. I 
appreciate you and your classmates 
helping with the set up.
Chris ENTERS carrying a small ELECTRIC MULTI-METER.  
CHRIS
Hey, dad, where do want the Multi-
Meter?
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Oh, I can take that, Chris  
He reaches out and notices the time on his watch as he does.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (CONT’D)
My!  How time flies.  
Carson leans in -
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 5.
 CARSON
Actually, time is a relative 
concept and therefore cannot 
actually fly... per say.
Professor Quantum gives him a quizzical look then regroups, 
turning to Chris.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Son, I need you to be in charge of 
the final preparations. 
He brightens at the responsibility.
CHRS
Really?
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (O.C.)
Guests will arrive in 15 minutes.
He places a hand on Chris’ shoulder in confidence.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (CONT’D)
Make sure the MAG-SYS looks perfect 
for the exhibition. It’s the 
highlight of my life’s work!  
Professor Quantum exits. Gizmo and Joy step up beside Chris, 
as Carson exits in the opposite direction. Chris gets a cocky 
attitude and leans up against a lighted column.
CHRIS
Yea-up.  I’m in charge.
Joy rolls her eyes as Gizmo leans in annoyed. 
GIZMO
Ah, Mr. “In Charge”?  Fingerprint 
Smudges!
Gizmo nods toward Chris’ hand on the column.  Chris yanks his 
hand away just as Gizmo revs his spinning brushes, <WHIRRRR> 
and polishes the post.  Chris and Joy quickly duck O.C.  
WIDER ANGLE
Chris <CLAPS> his hands to get the students moving.
CHRIS
Okay, people, we’ve got less than 
15 minutes.  Make sure everything 
looks great! And remember to...
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 6.
 A loud <CRACK> is heard as a giant flash of lighting strikes 
just outside.  The museum instantly goes dark while a 
SIZZLING ELECTRIC PULSE flickers through the fixtures.
STUDENTS (O.C.)
(CONCERNED WALLAH)
ANGLE ON QUANTUM’S DISPLAYS
ENERGY jumps through the lighted column... and across some of 
Quantum’s electronic displays. Over to Gizmo who REELS 
THROUGH as electricity arcs through him.  
GIZMO
WHHHHOOOOAAAAAAAA!!!!!
<O.C. SOUNDS OF METAL OBJECTS COLLIDING AND CLANGING> 
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY
CHRIS
Nobody panic! 
Suddenly, the backup power causes the LIGHTS flicker back on.
CARSON (O.C.)
Chris!  
Chris and Joy turn, react and dash O.C... towards...
ANGLE ON GIZMO NEAR THE DISPLAY TABLE  
Gizmo is lying on his back - (LAYOUT NOTE: NEVER SHOW Gizmo 
from behind from this point forward - also, never stage the 
kids BEHIND him.  We need to disguise the fact that the Mag-
Sys is now magnetized ONTO GIZMO’S BACK - a story payoff.) - 
Items are magnetized to him - a drill motor, tool belt with 
metal buckle, a metal sign.  Carson is helping him sit up.  
GIZMO
(woozy sounds)
CHRIS (O.C.)
Giz, are you ok?!
Chris knee-slides INTO FRAME and up to his downed buddy. Joy 
and students 1-8 quickly gather around behind.
STUDENTS
(Concerned wallah)
GIZMO
That lightning strike was so close 
that its electromagnetic pulse 
fried my.. (electro-spazzing 
sounds) 
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 7.
 FAVOR JOY as she leans over him. Chris looks to Joy.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
... turning me into a giant 
electromagnet. (effort)
He yanks the drill motor off and flips it away. <CRASH>
GIZMO (CONT’D)
I should be fine as long as I don’t 
become startled or...
(looking o.c. - pointing 
at the display table)
(big gasp) - CHRIIIISSS!
Gizmo GLOWS with an Electro-Magnetic <PULSE>.  The hammer and 
Drill motor fly back in and reattach. <CLINK-CLANK-THUNK>
GIZMO (CONT’D)
(OOOFFS AND IMPACT GRUNTS)
Simultaneously, Chris and Joy look where Gizmo pointed.  They 
react in surprise and Chris leaps to his feet. 
CHRIS
(gasp!) The MAG-SYS! It’s 
missing! 
STUDENTS (O.C.)
(concerned wallah)
WHIP PAN TO THE TABLE
The MAG-SYS pedestal is now empty. Chris dives INTO FRAME - 
His face is big in camera as he eyes the pedestal in alarm.
CHRIS 
Everybody, search!
Chris looks around in a panic. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
 We’ve got to find it!!!
WIDE ANGLE
All of the students search. Chris pulls Gizmo to his feet - 
sweeping a forefinger towards the display table. 
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Giz, check for fingerprints.  Go!
CAMERA FOLLOWS GIZMO -  He rushes around the display table. 
His FACEPLATE GENERATES A PURPLE LIGHT SCAN. 
ANGLE ON JOY 
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 8.
 She’s checking around the CUT-OUTS of Professor Quantum.  
Chris comes INTO FRAME, hands holding his head in dismay.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Joy, what am I gonna do?!  I gotta 
find out who took it! 
He looks off with a steely gaze.
POV 
The students are looking high and low.  Suddenly...
GIZMO
Chris!  Chris!  You were right!
BACK ON CHRIS AND JOY
Gizmo rushes up - brush attachment still spinning.
CHRIS
You found fingerprints?!? 
GIZMO
Yes.  And I polished them up so you 
can’t tell they were ever there!
JOY/CHRIS
You what?!?! / Giz! NO!!!
Gizmo leans back in surprise as Chris leans in...
CHRIS
Giz, you weren’t supposed to clean 
the fingerprints! 
JOY
You were supposed to collect them 
for evidence!
Gizmo pauses... looks at the brush attachment still 
spinning... And <POWERS DOWN>...
GIZMO
Yes.  That does make more sense.
Chris throws his hands up and storms through one archway, 
into a side hall.  
CHRIS
Ohhh!  The exhibit opens in just a 
few minutes.  What am I gonna do?!  
Gizmo and Joy share a look of concern and follow after him.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 9.
 INT. MUSEUM HALL - CONTINUOUS
Chris stands there, head hung low. Joy and Gizmo approach as 
SUPERBOOK suddenly whisks in from O.C.  The kids react.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
Superbook!
CHRIS
Wait! Superbook. No!  I’ve got to 
find out who took the MAG-woahhhh!
The kids are pulled up into the book and vortex out.

The kids land down on a small hilly path. 
JOY
Giz, get a reading on where we are.
FAVOR GIZMO
His geo-sensor goggles pop on, his head pops up and he 
surveys the landscape.
GIZMO
The year is approximately 970 BC.
GIZMO’S POV
Scans the landscape.
GIZMO (O.C.) (CONT’D)
We have been deposited somewhere 
between the ancient cities of 
Gibeon and Jerusalem.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 10.
 In the distance, a caravan of armed ISRAELITE SOLDIERS (970 
BC) - some on foot, some on camels and some chariots surround 
in formation an ornately decorated chariot. The soldiers have 
swords, spears and shields. They look intimidating.
ON GIZMO
The Goggle do a comical pop-take off his face and back on.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
Oh, oh.  I see soldiers, and they 
do not look friendly.
His head zips down O.C
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Gizmo’s head retracts down into his body with a THUNK. Chris 
is already grabbing his arm and heading O.C.
CHRIS
Quick, behind these bushes.
They dive behind some scrubby shrubs and rocks.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO

TRACKING SOLDIER #1 (On Horseback)
He approaches and the horses rears up nervously. <NEIGHING> 
(Soldier #1 and #2 are scouting ahead of the caravan.)
SOLDIER #1
Easy, what’s got you so startled?
SOLDIER #2 rides INTO FRAME beside him. 
SOLDIER #2
Probably smells a jackal. They’re 
all over these hills.
LOW ANGLE - ON THE KIDS BEHIND THE SHRUB - (FAVOR GIZMO)
A scorpion crawls down a branch and onto middle of Gizmo’s 
face screen. A cross-eyed Gizmo begins to shake.
GIZMO
(whipsering)
Get-away-get-away-get-away! 
JOY/CHRIS
(whispering)
Giz shhh!! / Quiet!
Gizmo lets off an ELECTROMAGNETIC CHARGE <SFX>
ANGLE ON SOLDIER #1 and SOLDIER #2
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 11.
 The soldiers look towards the bush. Their spears, swords and 
a shield start flying toward the giant magnet that is Gizmo.
SOLDIER #1/SOLDIER #2
(HUH?!  WHAT’S HAPPENING?!)
LOW ON GIZMO BEHIND THE BUSH
The scorpion crawls off as a shield hits Gizmo in the face as 
he sits up.
GIZMO
Ahhhhhh--ooofff (then 3 fast paced 
impact hits as....)
Two spears and swords fly point first. <BANG-THUD-WHAP>  - 
The weapons stick into the shield.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
(Groans... small impact hit)
Gizmo faints backwards.  The shield, looking like a giant pin 
cushion for weapons, falls to the ground. <THUNK>  Chris and 
Joy CRAWL INTO FRAME TRYING TO SIT GIZMO UP.
JOY/CHRIS 
Gizmo!!!(PUSHING AND SITTING HIM UP 
EFFORTS) 
OVER THEIR SHOULDERS, the shrubs part and we see Soldiers #1

What were you doing in the bushes? 
Are you a thief?
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 12.
 CHRIS
No!!!  In fact I’m trying to catch 
a thief... believe it or not... and 
we just got scared when...
SOLOMON (O.C.)
They hardly look dangerous.
ANGLE ON KING SOLOMON 
KING SOLOMON pulls to a stop in his chariot.
SOLDIER #1 (O.C.)
But, King Solomon, they were...
Solomon raises his hand for silence as gets off his chariot. 
SOLOMON 
Hiding from the big men with scary 
weapons. I would have done the same 
thing if I was them. Let them go.
WIDE SHOT ON THE GROUP
The soldiers release them as Solomon steps up. 
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Now dust yourselves off. 
He dusts Chris shoulders with a hand flick. Dust rises.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Can’t have you coming to my palace 
all dirty.
The dust moves toward Gizmo as Solomon turns and exits O.C. 
to his Chariot.  Gizmo waves the dust off.
GIZMO
(small cough - stopping as...)
Chris and Joy look at him askance.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
(defensively - low)
Wha-at?!  At least I didn’t magno-
yank his chariot towards us!
Chris and Joy roll their eyes and turn.  Gizmo them O.C.

CAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL Chris is riding a camel next 
Solomon on his chariot.  Gizmo and Joy are on the opposite 
side riding a camel. Gizmo is <RATTLING> up and down. The 
caravan follows behind.  (PROD NOTE: Wherever possible please 
shoot across the scene to avoid producing the massive line of 
soldiers moving behind them in too many cams.)
JOY
We should thank you for the ride!  
It’s not everyday one gets a lift 
from the King.
CLOSER ON GIZMO 
He is <RATTLING> UP AND DOWN.
GIZMO
Yes, but next time I call dibs on 
the King’s chariot!
TRACKING ON SOLOMON AND CHRIS
He laughs and then turns towards Chris. 
SOLOMON
(laughs)... Chris, did you say you 
were trying to catch a thief?
CHRIS
Yeah. -- My father trusted me with 
a prized possession of his.  
ON GIZMO AND JOY
GIZMO
And somebody stole it.
Joy shoots Gizmo a “Don’t rub it in look.” 
TRACKING - FAVOR SOLOMON
O.C. Solomon had turned to Gizmo and Joy.  He absorbs the 
weight of what Gizmo has revealed... and Joy’s reaction. He  
slowly turns to look back at Chris.  THE ANGLE SHIFTS WITH 
HIS GAZE to INCLUDE Chris, who rides with his head hung low.
SOLOMON
I might understand your situation 
better than you think, Chris. 
Chris angles his head towards King Solomon but says nothing. 
Solomon then looks ahead, tending to his driving... A beat...
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 14.
 SOLOMON (CONT’D)
My father was king before I was. 
King David.  And he entrusted me 
with all of Israel.
TRACKING CLOSE ON CHRIS
He looks off at the horizon.
CHRIS
I can’t even lead a science class. 
Hmgh.. Can’t imagine having to lead 
an entire nation. 
A beat... Chris turns to look at Solomon.

 His eyes well as he lovingly clutches his father’s hand. 
KING DAVID (CONT’D)
Do what the Lord your God commands 
and follow his teachings. Obey 
everything written in the Law of 
Moses.
He is listening intently. His eyes study his father’s face.
KING DAVID (O.C.) (CONT’D)

He will see that I succeed.
TRACKING CLOSE ON CHRIS
He is looking over at King Solomon working his chariot 
forward.  Chris considers what he’s heard, then...
CHRIS
You took over after your father 
died.  But my father’s waiting for 
me back home.  And when he finds 
out how badly I messed up... 
TRACKING ON SOLOMON 
SOLOMON
Whether you’re a king or a servant, 
“Give your burdens to the Lord, and 
he will take care of you.

Joy’s plate is almost empty.  Chris hasn’t touched a thing. 
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 17.
 JOY
Chris, why don’t you try to eat 
something. This food’s delicious.
He shoves his plate away and leans back, crossing his arms.
CHRIS
I can’t. 
MS - Chris looks lost for a beat. Then.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Somebody in the museum had to have 
stolen the MAG-SYS. That means it’s 
probably still there somewhere.
ANOTHER ANGLE - MEDIUM SHOT - UP ANGLE
Solomon approaches them - several revelers pass behind him 
but please avoid a shot of the party-filled hall.
SOLOMON
And what are my new friends up to? 
JOY
Still trying to solve Chris’ 
mystery.
FAVOR SOLOMON AND CHRIS
SOLOMON
Maybe that’s the problem?
CHRIS
What are you talking about?
ON GIZMO
He gets slightly indignant.
GIZMO
Yes!  If Chris does not think 
logically.  If he does not consider 
every possible solution.  If he 
does not act on his deductive 
reasoning... He will never solve 
this or any other problem.
WIDER ON GROUP
Solomon sits and muses...
SOLOMON
Hmmm...
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 18.
 GIZMO
Hmmm?!  That is what you are 
offering someone who is searching 
for an answer... a solution... an 
inspiration?!
CLOSE ON SOLOMON
He smiles... lost in thought.
SOLOMON
It is better to trust in the Lord 
than to put confidence in man. 
(Psalm 118:8 NKJV) 
ANGLE ON THE KIDS
They look at one another a bit confused.
ANGLE ON SOLOMON
He leans in.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Is your confidence in Chris?  Or is 
it in God?
A beat.  Solomon rises and exits, leaving the kids to 
consider this.  They slowly exchange looks.  
CHRIS
I never thought about it that way 
before.
JOY
(trying it out)
Maybe that means your confidence is 
in Chris.
A long beat... PUSH ON CHRIS.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PALACE OF DAVID - LATER THAT NIGHT
ESTABLISHING SHOT - fewer lights are visible...
INT. PALACE OF DAVID ROOM - NIGHT
Joy is asleep on her bed. Gizmo is sitting against the wall, 
the beds, powered down.  Joy hears something and turns...

 CHRIS (O.C.)
(whispers/mumbles)
POV
Far across the room, a GLOW from an oil lamp frames Chris, 
lying in his bed praying. CAMERA PUSHES TO him.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Please dear God, My father will be 
so disappointed if the exhibit 
doesn’t open because of me. 
MS Camera arcs around Chris’ bed. We can hear his prayer now.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Please help me.  I want to put my 
trust in you and not me. But... I’m 
not used to that... and... Okay... 
I’m here God... I’m trying. Amen.
Chris leans over and blows out the lamp.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
(blowing lamp out)
BACK ON JOY
We see her just as the light fades.  She smiles to herself.
DISSOLVE TO:

Chris is asleep. Screaming Voices come up from OUTSIDE.
WOMAN#1 / WOMAN#2 (O.C.)
(It’s my baby, and you know 
it! - Your baby! You stole 
him from me as I slept!) 
BABY (O.C.)
(CRYING)
Chris wakes bolt upright.
WOMAN #1 (O.C.)
Look, now you’re making him cry!
Gizmo comes rushing in. Joy is right behind him.
GIZMO
Chris, Chris!  Come quickly!  
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 20.
 JOY
Two women have arrived to meet with 
King Solomon and they are fighting 
over a baby!
GIZMO
And each one claims they are the 
REAL mother!
Chris, leaps up, grabs his shoes and they all dash out.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PALACE OF DAVID GARDEN/COURTYARD - MORNING
Solomon is walking through the garden, hand behind his back - 
lost in thoughts. The kids call out as they run to him.
JOY/CHRIS/GIZMO
King Solomon!/We heard 
everything!/Those women want you to 
decide which is the real mother.
They breathlessly stop before him.
CHRIS
What are you going to do?
SOLOMON
(sigh) - Not long ago, I sacrificed 
a thousand burnt offerings to Lord 
in worship to Him. That night, the 
Lord came to me and said I could 
ask for anything I wanted and He 
would give it to me.
FAVOR CHRIS WITH JOY AND GIZMO
He looks to Joy and Gizmo to see if they’re tracking this.  
They appear as confused as he is. He looks back at Solomon.
CHRIS
What did you ask for?
CLOSE ON SOLOMON
SOLOMON
Wisdom.
ON GROUP
Gizmo is totally confused.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 21.
 GIZMO
Wisdom?!  But God was asking!  I 
mean you could have requested 
anything!  A super-long life!  
Riches beyond your dreams!
ON CHRIS ACROSS TO SOLOMON
SOLOMON
(finishing it)
I asked for wisdom.
Solomon turns to look at Chris.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
And God will grant the same to 
anyone, if he asks from his heart.
A beat... Chris absorbs this and Solomon turns and exits.
CUT TO:
INT. PALACE OF DAVID THRONE ROOM - MORNING
20 Israelites line the hall - ten along both side walls.  
(Reuse the group that greeted Solomon’s entry to the city.)
ISRAELITES 
(anticipatory wallah to carry 
through scene)
ANGLE ON DOORS
Chris, Joy and Gizmo enter and take a position by a column 
that divides the court from a side court. ISRAELITE #1 and 
ISRAELITE #2 are nearest the kids. 
ISRAELITE #1
Without any witnesses, there is no 
way for the King to know whose baby 
it is!
PUSH IN ON GIZMO
He brightens and thrusts a forefinger in the air.
GIZMO
Why don’t we use DNA samples to 
determine which woman is the true 
biological mother.
Joy and Chris lean in close.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 22.
 CHRIS
Wait!  Giz, that’s a great idea!
JOY
I gotta say, sometimes, when you’re 
brilliant you’re brilliant.  
ISRAELITES (O.C.)
(RAISING IN UPROAR)
ANGLE AT THE DOOR
The two women are about to be led in.
WOMAN#1/WOMAN#2
It’s my baby! The king will settle 
this now / The King will determine 
the baby is mine! Etc.
BACK ON THE KIDS 
Gizmo’s chest opens up. He produces a SCROLL and he starts 
towards the entrance.
GIZMO
All I need are a few hair samples 
to analyze, and our little mystery 
will be solved.
ANGLE NEAR DOORS
With obvious “nonchalance”, Gizmo APPROACHES, reading the 
scroll (like a newspaper) and whistles as he walks. 
GIZMO (CONT’D)
(NONCHALANT WHISTLING)
OFFICIAL #1 (O.C.
Make way, make way!
The crowd begins to part. WOMAN #1 and #2 are led by 
Officials #1 and #2. OFFICIAL #1 is carrying a baby. 
CLOSE ON GIZMO
Two tiny tweezers discreetly extend from the tips of two 
fingers... appearing below the scroll. 
Woman # 1 and Woman #2 pass.  Gizmo quickly extends the two 
tweezers behind both women and simultaneously plucks strands 
of their long hair from one woman... and then the other. They 
pass O.C. Gizmo retracts his arm.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
(sigh of relief)
WIDE ON THRONE ROOM
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 23.
 The women are led to stand in the middle of the room facing 
Solomon’s empty throne. OFFICIAL#1 and the BABY walk off to 
the side and stand just in front of Chris and Joy.
PUSH IN ON THE KIDS
Gizmo joins Chris and Joy.  The Official holds the baby so 
that it is peering over the Official’s shoulder
BABY
(BABY SOUNDS)
GIZMO looks at Chris and Joy. They mime-indicate he should 
get going and retrieve a sample from the baby.  Gizmo gives 
them a confident smile then his tweezer attachment pops out 
and aim for the child.  
PUSH IN ON the tweezers.  The approach the baby - the baby 
goes cross-eyed watching the tweezers approach his forehead 
hairline.  <BINK> The tweezers quickly plucks a strand of the 
baby’s hair and retract O.C. He reacts with a shocked 
expression. Then his face puckers. He’s about to cry...
BABY (CONT’D)
(BEGINNING TO WHIMPER)
Gizmo’s hand ENTERS FRAME and quickly grabs the baby’s thumb 
and <PLOPS> it in his mouth.  The baby, shocked once more - 
but pacified, begins to sucks his thumb.
BABY (CONT’D)
(THUMB SUCKING)
The Official with the baby EXITS FRAME - heading for the 
women.
BACK ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Gizmo’s holding the strands of hair in his open hand.
CHRIS
Giz, hurry!  We need that DNA 
analyzed!
GIZMO quickly opens his chest, grabs an envelope, puts the 
strands inside it, then puts it back in his chest.  Chris and 
Joy look at each other confused. Gizmo looks up at them.
GIZMO
I’ll send them off to the lab as 
soon as we get home. We should have 
the results in six to eight weeks.
Chris slaps his forehead. Joy shakes her head in disbelief.

WHAT?/GIZMO!!!
ISRAELITES (O.C.)
(walla)The king is here / What will 
he do? / How will he know?
Chris, Joy and Gizmo turn to look.
THEIR POV 
Solomon enters and sits on his Throne.   Solomon looks at the 
women. He then makes eye contact with Official #1 standing 
next to Woman #1. Solomon nods him to speak.
CLOSE ON THE OFFICIALS AND THE WOMEN
Official #1 whispers into Woman #1’s ear then both officials 
step back just over each woman’s inside shoulder.  WOMAN #1 
takes a small step forward. She looks around. Then focuses on 
Solomon.
WOMAN #1 (1 KINGS 3:17-21 CEV)
Your Majesty, this woman and I live 
in the same house. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They watch and listen in total concentration.
WOMAN #1 (CONT’D)
Not long ago my baby was born at 
home, and three days later her baby 
was born. 
CLOSE ON WOMAN #1
WOMAN #1 (O.C (CONT’D)
Nobody else was there with us.  One 
night while we were all asleep, she 
rolled over on her baby, and he 
died.

Joy covers her mouth in shock.
JOY
(GASP)
ON SOLOMON AND WOMAN #1
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 25.
 The woman is distraught and having a difficult time speaking.  
Solomon nods and gives a slight hand gesture indicating she 
should continue.  Woman #1 looks over her shoulder at the 
other woman.
WOMAN #1
Then while I was still asleep, she 
got up and took my son out of my 
bed. 
She tuns back to Solomon - CAMERA PUSHES IN.
WOMAN #1 (CONT’D)
She put him in her bed, then she 
put her dead baby next to me.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO AND SEVERAL ISRAELITES
The Israelites gasp and murmur.  The kids stare, awestruck.
ISRAELITES
(walla /gasps of disbelief)
BACK ON WOMAN #1
Woman #2 and the Official with the baby are right behind her.
WOMAN #1
In the morning when I got up to 
feed my son, I saw that he was 
dead. But when I looked at him in 
the light, I knew he wasn't my son.
Woman #2 rushes forward.
WOMAN #2
No! He was your son. My baby is 
alive!
WOMAN #1
The dead baby is yours. Mine is 
alive!
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY, GIZMO AND THE ISRAELITES  
They react, stunned.
ISRAELITES
(walla) It must be her baby/who 
could do such a thing/I don’t know 
who I believe.
PUSH IN ON the kids as the whisper.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 26.
 JOY
What’s Solomon going to do?
GIZMO
Without a DNA test there is no way 
to know for sure whose baby it 
really is!
PUSH IN ON CHRIS
He watches O.C. Solomon with intensity.
CLOSE ON SOLOMON 
He closes his eyes. IN a SOUND EFFECT - all throne room 
sounds suddenly rush out of the room - There is nothing but 
silence... and the sound of a <BEATING HEART>. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS
Still staring at Solomon with intensity.  What’s he doing?  
Everything is silent but the <HEARTBEAT>
EXTREME CLOSE ON SOLOMON
He mouths - but audible in a whisper.
SOLOMON
Lord, grant me wisdom.
ANGLE WIDENS SLIGHTLY as he Holy Spirit Affect overtakes him.
BACK ON CHRIS
He has read Solomon’s lips and straightens up - almost 
imperceptibly as all the ROOM SOUND COMES RUSHING BACK.
WIDE ON SOLOMON AND THE WOMEN
He rise.  The crowd quiets.  The women look nervous.
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Both of you say this live baby is 
yours.
Solomon approaches and studies both women.  They both look 
downward - avoiding his gaze. 
ON CHRIS JOY AND GIZMO AND THE NEARBY CROWD
Waiting in anticipation.
ON THE BABY
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 27.
 He turns his head - only appearing to be waiting in 
anticipation.

He look out and calls in a strong voice.  
SOLOMON (CONT’D)
Someone bring me a sword!

INT. PALACE OF DAVID THRONE ROOM - SAME
Soldier #1 approaches and holds sword up for Solomon.  
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
They stare wide-eyed.
JOY
What’s he doing?!
ON SOLOMON
He looks at the sword blade... looks around the room... Then  
looks straight at the two women.  They seem frozen in fear. 
SOLOMON (1 KINGS 3:25 CEV)
Cut the baby in half!  That way 
each of you can have part of him.
ISRAELITES
(Shocked wallah)
ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Joy covers her mouth. Gizmo covers his eyes.

Gizmo falls.  <MAGNETIC PULSE> and several bowls, and metal 
ornaments fly to him. <KLUNK-THUNK-BOINK>
ON OFFICIAL #1 
He steps forward with the baby, approaching Solomon.  As he 
passes Woman #1 she falls to her knees, wailing. 
WOMAN #1 (1KINGS 3:26 CEV)
Please don’t kill my son!  Your 
Majesty, I love him very much, but 
give him to her. Just don’t kill 
him!
ANGLE ON WOMAN #2
She crosses her arms in defiance. 
WOMAN #2 (1 KINGS 3:26 CEV)
Go ahead and cut him in half.  Then 
neither of us will have the baby.
FAVOR SOLOMON
Official #1 is holding the baby before Solomon, on one side 
of frame.  Soldier #1 is holding the sword upright, offering 
it to Solomon on the others side of frame
SOLOMON (1 KINGS 3:27 NLT)
Do not kill the child, but give him 
to the woman who wants him to live, 
for she is his mother!
ANGLE ON WOMAN #1
She is still on her knees and bows down in tears.

 Soldier #1 puts his sword away.  Solomon sits on his throne 
and strikes wise-kingly pose, watching the drama before him,  
Woman #1 is rising and hugging her baby.  Woman #2 is 
escorted out by Official #1 and #2.
CLOSE ON CHRIS
Watching Solomon... awestruck.
CHRIS
(to himself)
God gave him the wisdom to solve 
that problem in a way no one else 
could.
 <SUPERBOOK SFX>.  The kids spy the SB FX behind a pillar and 
quickly move to it.
JOY
Superbook!  Come on!
The kids are transported out in the SB FX.
WIPE TO:
INT. MUSEUM ATRIUM - THE MAG-SYS DISPLAY - EVENING
We see the kids drop back down in the adjoining hall and 
hurry out into the Atrium. CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they run to 
the display table, where Professor Quantum standing and 
scratching his head over what to do.  
CHRIS
Dad!  We’ve been looking all over 
for the MAG-SYS. It disappeared 
when we lost power. I’m sorry.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Chris, it was the centerpiece of 
the exhibition. Without it... 
(sigh)... I don’t know what to do.
He turns away, shoulders slumping.  
PUSH IN ON CHRIS - the SOUND IS PULLED FROM THE ROOM - just 
like we heard it happen for Solomon.  There is nothing but 
Chris’ heartbeat.  He closes his eyes.
CHRIS
(whispered)
Lord, give me wisdom.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 30.
 A beat... nothing... then, very subtly, the Holy Spirit 
Affect overcomes him.  Another beat... Chris opens his eyes.  
The ROOM SOUNDS SLOWLY RETURN to normal.  Students are 
starting to gather.
STUDENT #1
Chris, what are you going to do.
Chris is suddenly filled by an idea.  He scans the kids in 
front of him.
CHRIS
Giz! Whoever took the Mag-Sys would 
have left some DNA behind, right?! 
Scan the display for DNA evidence!
ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE JOY and Prof Quantum
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
But Chris, Gizmo can’t …
JOY
(overriding)
Ah, Professor Quantum, I think 
Chris has this one covered.
Gizmo starts to examine and scan the empty pedestal with a 
green scanning ray from his face-plate.  
ON CHRIS
CHRIS
Everybody’s DNA is one of a kind. 
Identify the DNA, you identify the 
thief.
WIDEN TO INCLUDE GIZMO
He is opening up an envelope and dusting unseen cells into it 
with a small brush.
GIZMO
Chris!  You are correct! My DNA 
scan found hair and skin cells. Now 
all I have to do is...
Suddenly, someone is pushing through the group of students.  
They part to reveal... Carson.  
CARSON
WAIT! I did it!
GIZMO
...send them off does anybody 
have a postage stamp?... 
Wait, you did what?
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 31.
 CARSON
It was me.
PROF QUANTUM/CHRIS/JOY
Carson, you?/You stole it?/But Why?
CLOSE ON CARSON
CARSON
I didn’t steal it... I... just 
wanted to touch a piece of history. 
So I picked up the MAG-SYS when 
nobody was looking. I accidentally 
dropped it when the lightning hit. 
The case cracked and I panicked.
Carson bends down and lifts the table skirt.
CARSON (CONT’D)
So, I hid it right... (GASP) - It’s 
gone! 
A panicked look overtakes him. He leaps to his feet.
CARSON (CONT’D)
I slid it under the table right 
before the power went out. I’m 
certain of it!
ANOTHER ANGLE TO INCLUDE QUANTUM AND THE STUDENTS
The students begin to wave him off and walk away.
STUDENTS
(dismissive - blaming wallah)
Carson tugs on Chris’ sleeve, pleading with him.
CARSON
Chris... look... you made me admit 
my mistake.  But I don’t have the 
Mag-Sys!   
ON CHRIS
He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. 
CHRIS
(DEEP BREATH) I believe you, 
Carson.  But... then where is it?
He turns to look.  
ANGLE SHIFTS TO INCLUDE GIZMO 
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 32.
 Giz is standing next to the empty MAG-SYS display. He turns 
to look around we see the Mag-Sys ON Gizmo’s back.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Giz? Is that what I think it is?
Chris grabs Gizmo’s head and pulls it up and out so that it 
extends and turns so Gizmo is now looking at his own back. 
Gizmo “scratches” his head. He looks to Chris.
GIZMO
(chuckle)  It has been there the 
whole time? Embarrassing. (chuckle)
WIDER ON GROUP
Professor Quantum ENTERS FRAME and quickly detaches the MAG-
SYS from Gizmo’s back.  He surveys the damage. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Well, it’s seen better days, but 
it’s certainly fixable. 
Quantum turns and puts his arm around and dejected Carson. 
PROFESSOR QUANTUM (CONT’D)
What do you say we get this back on 
display and open the exhibition?!
Carson brightens and quickly takes the MAG-SYS, placing it on 
the display pedestal. 
CARSON
Sounds like a super plan!
TRACKING QUANTUM
He moves to Chris and puts a hand on Chris’ shoulder.
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
You did a very impressive job 
there, getting Carson to step up 
and admit the truth.  
CHRIS
Thanks dad.  I had... an old friend 
give me some good advice.
FAVOR GIZMO
He brightens.
EP #311 - KING SOLOMON - Baldwin - 3-15-13 Pre-Pro Draft 33.
 GIZMO
Well, if I’m no longer needed here,   
I’m going to check out the OUTER 
SPACE exhibits, before the crowd 
arrives.
Gizmo exits through one of the archways. 
JOY
(giggle) Think we should tell him 
he just walked into the BUGS and 
CREEPY CRAWLER exhibit?
She points up and we see the signs over the archways.
GIZMO (O.C.)
Butterflies, Spiders! SCORPIONS!
A quick flash emits from the Insect Hall and the sounds of 
<CLASHING> and <CLANGING> in an over the top symphony of 
metallic collisions.
Gizmo exits the exhibit with a plethora of metallic objects 
stuck to him: signs, brochure displays - with brochures still 
in them, and a rope divider post dragging the rope. <CLANGING-
BANGING> 
GIZMO (CONT’D)
The SPACE exhibit is this way.
Gizmo walks past Chris, Joy, Gizmo and Professor Quantum 
dragging his metal appendages. <CLANGING-BANGING>
PROFESSOR QUANTUM
Guess I should probably replace 
that circuit board as soon as 
possible.

Carson steps in and joins the LAUGHTER with a decidedly geeky 
chortling laugh that makes everyone else just laugh harder.
