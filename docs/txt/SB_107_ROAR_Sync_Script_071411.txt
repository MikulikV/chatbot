SYNOPSIS: Chris is morally challenged, “to do the right thing,” 
when a smaller boy is harassed by bullies at the skateboard park.  
SUPERBOOK whisks the kids off to an adventure where they meet 
Daniel and King Darius, as an edict is struck saying that no one 
shall worship anyone but the king, at the risk of death.  Daniel 
is a spiritual man, and when his faith is challenged in this way, 
he never backs down for an instance. He does what he knows in his 
heart is the right thing to do. The kids' are stunned to watch as 
Daniel prays before an open window for all to witness.  This 
action gets him hauled off and thrown into the lion pit.  Our 
heroes try to do what they can but when it seems all is lost, God 
intervenes and Daniel is saved.  As a result, the King has an 
epiphany and commands all to now worship Daniel's one true God.  
Chris understands that because Daniel had the courage to do what 
was right, he changed the people around him.  When Superbook 
returns the kids to the skateboard park, Chris now has the inner 
strength to stand up for what he knows is right, where the younger 
boy and the bully are concerned.  When you do what's right, God is 
your protector.
TAKE-AWAY:  You should stand for what is right (for what you 
believe in) no matter how difficult it may seem.

 FADE IN:
EXT. SKATEBOARD PARK - TWILIGHT
ANGLE ON the evening sky with a few puffy, sunset clouds. A 
perfect evening. Suddenly, we hear...

CHRIS (O.S.)
WOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!
CHRIS FLIES INTO FRAME, in mid-air, on a skateboard, wearing 
a helmet, knee pads and elbow pads. He also wears appropriate 
clothing for the sport.  He is NOT DRESSED IN HIS SCHOOL 
UNIFORM. He does a spin and CAMERA FOLLOWS him downward as 
his board <THUNKS> on the deck...
CHRIS (CONT’D)
(hard landing effort)
ANGLE ON A LARGE VERT RAMP - Chris ENTERS SHOT AT THE BOTTOM 
OF FRAME and speeds UPWARDS - EXTREME DUTCH CAMERA TRACKING 
HIM - to the very top, where he Ollie’s, skateboarder 3 is 
watching at the top of the ramp (Note: THREE SKATE-BOARDING 
KIDS are seen in the B.G. One African American Boy (10), An 
Asian Girl (15) and an Indian Girl (8) ...
CHRIS (CONT’D)
YEAAAAAAAAH!
... and exits out of frame down the vert ramp.

ANGLE BELOW ON THE SIDELINES - JOY (wearing her backpack BUT 
NOT WEARING HER SCHOOL UNIFORM - perhaps slacks) and GIZMO 
cheer.  
JOY/GIZMO
(Ad-lib cheering for Chris - 
Alright, Chris!  Big air!)
Chris jumps onto the rail and grinds down to the other side 
where he leaps off of the rail and onto a circular 
embankment.  The camera tracks Chris around the embankment 
and over a hill.  Chris jumps the hill while spinning his 
board in the air lands the jump and skates OC. 
JOY/GIZMO (CONT’D)
(Ad-lib cheering / applauding)
Chris slides back into frame with the nose of his board in 
the air coming to a stop in front of Giz and Joy.

 There is a flash of BLUE LIGHT behind a large drapery 
decorating one side of the room.  
GIZMO (O.S.)
Oooops!
King Darius turns his head in the direction of the drapery 
but shrugs it off and turns back.  
THE KIDS AND GIZMO peek out from behind a room dividing 
curtain - they see the king - and suddenly duck back out of 
sight.
CHRIS
Giz, where are we?
BEHIND THE CURTAIN
The kids hunker together and WHISPER....

KING
Daniel, my friend. You have found 
great favor with my court.

JOY
I wish I had your strength.
FAVOR CHRIS as he watches this.  
CHRIS
(softly)
Joy...
Chris’ eyes open slightly wider - he pauses -- then he 
realizes he does not have the same strength.  His eyes close 
and his head lowers as he turns away. He knows he can’t be 
this strong yet.
ANGLE UP ON DANIEL AS JOY ENTERS FRAME
DANIEL
Kneel with me. I will teach you how 
to pray.
ANGLE ON WINDOW AS THEY KNEEL DOWN TOGETHER
(STAGING NOTE - Joy should be kneeling - she is lower than

she would NOT be visible outside the window.  Only Daniel 
would be visible to passersby on the street below.)
