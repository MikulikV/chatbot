Episode #204
"RAHAB AND THE WALLS OF JERICHO"
CBN APPROVED TAKE-AWAY: "Opposing sides can unite for a 
shared purpose."
LOG LINE: Joy is having a difficult time with the idea of 
sharing work on a school project with a seemingly unfriendly 
and competitive student.  However, once Superbook takes our 
trio back to the fall of Jericho, where Joy meets Rahab, she 
comes to realize that people can change, and those who seem 
to be adversaries can sometimes turn out to be allies who 
will work with you for a greater good.

an army fortified by walls so high

*
TEACHER (CONT’D)

*
Becky, you and Joy seem to be 
*
working along the same lines.  
*
Would you like to team up?
*
Becky looks at Joy - unsure - then when Joy isn’t quick 
*
enough to volunteer, Becky covers.
*
BECKY
11
*
No thank you.  She probably copied 
*
me anyway...
*
JOY
12
*
What?  I’d never -- <testy ‘ooo!’>

Insulted, Joy marches away with her project in hand.  The

GIZMO

It is designed for one player and

works in real time and in real 
environments!  But I figured out 
how to be in it too.
Chris and Gizmo unhook from their tethers.
*
CHRIS
16
*
Say... aren’t you supposed to be 
*
out there working with Becky!

JOY
17
How do you know that?
PARABOLIC MICROPHONES pop out of Chris's helmet and Gizmo's 
head and <WHIR> to and fro like radar dishes.
GIZMO
18
Hel-lo?  
CHRIS
19
We're spies?
The earpieces retract as...
CHRIS (CONT’D)
20
Don’t you want to work with her?
JOY
21
More like she doesn’t want to work 
with me!  <humph> Fine!  I wouldn’t 
work with her in a million years!
WIDER - Superbook rises.  The supper effect begins.

 JOSHUA (CONT’D)

How thick are the city walls?  How

plentiful are their supplies.  
*
TWO SHOT OF JOSHUA AND SECOND
*
They look up from the map and turn to one another.
*
JOSHUA (CONT’D)
30
*
How many soldiers they have.

This mission calls for our very

best spies.

Spies, reporting for duty, sir!

JOSHUA AND THE SECOND - 
They turn and react as the guys step forward.  
*
JOSHUA
34
Aren’t you a bit young to be spies?
CHRIS
35
That’s what makes us so perfect for 
this.  We’re sly, we’re stealthy --

 GIZMO
36
And not to mention lethal.  Ha-ha, 
*
hah!
Gizmo makes karate-chops and accidentally falls over.  
*
Joshua and the Second trade looks -- then burst out laughing.  
Joshua pats Chris on the head.
JOSHUA/SECOND
37
<laughter>
JOSHUA
38
<chuckle>  Very amusing, children.  
But this calls for real spies.
ANGLE ON TENT FLAP 
*
SPY #1 and SPY #2 enter.  They look like ordinary Israelite 
*
men.
*
BACK ON CHRIS AND GIZMO
*
They stare in surprise.
*
CHRIS
39
*
Those are spies?!
*
GIZMO
40
*
Yes, where are their spy gadgets?
*
CHRIS
41
*
Yeah, these guys are going to be 
*
helpless without us.
*
(leaning in whispering)
*
Giz, we better shadow them if this 
*
mission is ever going to succeed.

REVERSE FAVOR JOY

She looks askance at Chris and Gizmo.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WALLED CITY OF JERICHO - AT GATE - LATE AFTERNOON ALMOST *
DUSK
*
TORCHLIGHT REVEALS a LINE OF TRAVELERS and FARMERS with HAND 
*
CARTS, or walking DONKEYS laden with baskets of grain.

 They are being checked by guards.  There is an OX and CART in 
the group. 
*
TRAVELERS / FARMERS
42
<impatient walla>
*
CLOSER AT GATE 
*
A burly CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD scans the scene.  
RAHAB, (young 20’s) is decked out in scarves and jewelry made 
of coins saunters over. 
*
RAHAB
43
The line into Jericho is moving 
slowly tonight, Captain.  Have your 
men fallen asleep?
CAPTAIN
44
Ha... I don’t have time for jokes, 
*
Rahab.  
*
RAHAB
45
(coy)
You know I am dependent on 
*
travelers. And I’m concerned about 
*
not having travelers in my boarding 
*
house tonight unless you can... 
*
move things along.
*
The Captain looks at her as she demurely lowers her eyes.
CAPTAIN
46
*
You should be more concerned about 
*
the Israelites.
*
The Captain leans in, confiding, enjoy being close to Rehab.  *
RAHAB
47
*
The Israelites?  What do you mean?
*
CAPTAIN
48
They’ve begun arriving and making 
*
camp on the east side of the Jordan 
*
River. Thousands of them.
*
Rahab seems interested and steps forward to look out the 
*
gate.

 RAHAB
49
*
Really? - I have heard stories 
*
about their amazing God and the 
*
things He has done.  
*
The Captain smiles.
*
CAPTAIN
50
*
Well, if they try to attack their 
*
victories end here at Jericho.  
*
Because the Israelites and their 
*
god are no match for my men and our 
*
walls.
*
He taps the wall with his weapon.
*
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
*
They hide behind an Ox cart.  Joy peers up from behind the 
*
cart to overhear.
*
JOY’S POV
*
Rahab spaks to the captain.
*
RAHAB
51
*
Hmm... I don’t know... Perhaps it 
*
is you, Captain, who should have 
*
more concern tonight.  Their God is 
*
very powerful.
*
CAPTAIN
52
Humph.  And our walls are very 
*
strong. 
*
RAHAB
53
Of course, Captain.  Good night. 
*
She exits as a Guard moves up to the Captain.
*
GUARD
54
*
Hmgh... Captain, what did Rahab 
*
want?
*
PAN TO JOY
*
She drops down beside Gizmo and Chris, crouching behind a 
*
CART.  Chris looks about with binoculars.
*
CHRIS
55
I don’t see those spies anywhere.

 JOY
56
Did you notice how that woman acted 
*
when that soldier talked about the 
Israelites?
TWO SHOT CHRIS AND GIZMO
*
Chris hands the binoculars to Gizmo who opens his chest and 
places them inside as...
CHRIS
57
Yeah, whatever.  Now, can we figure 
out how to sneak past those guards?
(beat, in hero mode)
Gizmo -- I need options.
GIZMO
58
Well, we could use a rocket pack to 
get over the wall -- 
INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS as Chris considers each of Gizmo’s offers.
CHRIS
59
Mmm... Too obvious.
*
GIZMO
60
Or perhaps use fireworks as a 
diversion -- 
CHRIS
61
Naw... Too dangerous.
*
MEDIUM ON GROUP - as Joy shoots them an impatient look.
JOY
62
<sigh> Or, we could do this.
She covers her head with her shawl and marches off.
AT GATES 
*
Joy joins the line and with her head down, walks through 
undisturbed.
GIZMO AND CHRIS
*
Watch her go, then look at one another - beat - and agree in 
*
unison:
CHRIS / GIZMO
63
Too easy.

 They tiptoe off in the opposite direction with exaggerated 
stealth.  
HOLD ON THE CART as its Owner tugs the Ox’s lead.  The cart 
<RUMBLES> forward.
CAPTAIN (O.S.)
64
Hurry along.  We’ve got to shut the 
gates for the night.
EXTREME LOW REVERSE ANGLE - reveals the two Spies cling to 
the undercarriage of the cart and ride through the gate 
unseen.
CUT TO:
EXT. JERICHO - STREET - MEANWHILE

Joy tries to follow Rahab - she disappears around a corner.
*
CUT TO:
*
EXT. WALLED CITY OF JERICHO - AT GATE - CONTINUOUS
*
An Oxcart rolls by the Captain.  Beat.  He reacts and turns 
*
his head.  
*
CAPTAIN’S POV 
*
The foot of one of the spies is visible beneath a cart. Then 
*
PASSERSBY cross THROUGH SHOT, blocking CAMERA’s view.
BACK ON THE CAPTAIN 
*
He has a quizzical look.  He hurries in the direction the 
*
cart went.  
In QUICK CUTS:
LOW ANGLE A FLOCK OF BIRDS scatters ahead of him.
*
A VENDOR - with a hand-cart accidentally cuts him off. (The 
*
Ox cart is out of view)
CAPTAIN 
65
*
Out of my way!
*
THE CAPTAIN - He hurries around the back of the hand-cart and 
finally catches up to the Oxcart.

 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
66
Halt in the name of the King!
The Captain leans down and peers under the cart... but the 
*
Spies have slipped away!  As the Captain stands and scowls, 
and looks around...
*
CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
67

(scowling sounds)
*
FADE OUT.
*
END OF ACT ONE
*
ACT TWO
*
FADE IN:
*
EXT. JERICHO MARKET PLACE - SUNSET
*
Vendors tend to their wares by TORCHLIGHT -- one stacks 
*
pomegranates; the other folds linens.
*
People are leaving for the night.  
*
Joy peers around a corner.
*
RAHAB (O.C.)
68
*
(laughter)
*
Joy exits in the direction of the O.C. laughter.
*
ANGLE ON STALL
*
Rahab is laughing with VENDOR #1.
*
VENDOR #1
69
*
(Whispering then chuckling with 
*
Rahab)
*
RAHAB
70
*
(laughter)
*
A MATRON standing nearby turns up her nose and strides away.
*
MATRON
71
*
Hmmggh!
*
RAHAB - notices.  Pained, she turns and goes on her way then 
*
strengthens and raises her chin.

 ANOTHER STALL
*
RAHAB - stops to examine some fabric at another stall.
*
RAHAB
72
*
Oh, these are lovely.  Did they 
*
just arrive?
*
VENDOR #2
73
*
Yes.  They’re beautiful and a great 
*
value.  
*
Joy approaches at the other end of the stall and pretends to 
*
be looking at fabrics.  Rahab notes her... then moves away.
*
Joy suddenly realizes she’s gone looks around, puzzled.
*
JOY’S POV - no sign of Rahab to the left, to the right...
RESUME JOY - Rahab is suddenly behind her.  
RAHAB
74
Are you some kind of spy?
Joy jumps - a little startled.
JOY
75
Hunh?  Oh, ah... No!
*
RAHAB
76
That’s odd, because you’ve been 
following me ever since you came 
through the city gate.  And, 
obviously, you’re not from around 
here.
JOY - looks at her own clothes and then at Rehab’s garb. 
JOY
77
You... noticed.
Rahab smiles; she sees Joy is no threat. 
RAHAB
78
*
You know... you would look so much 
*
better in green. 
*
She takes a scarf from the vendor’s table and holds it up 
*
beside Joy’s head.

*
Let’s see.
*
She puts it on Joy.  
*
JOY
80
*
(giggle)
*
Joy does a girlish spin.
*
JOY (CONT’D)
81
*
What do you think?
*
Rahab smiles.
*
RAHAB
82
*
Oh!  Definitely!
*
WIPE TO:
*
EXT. OUTSIDE WALL OF JERICHO - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
*
A DOWN ANGLE finds Gizmo and Chris scaling the sheer stone 
*
wall; each has TWO OVERSIZED SUCTION CUPS strapped to their 
*
knees and TWO MORE held in their hands.  The CUPS make goofy 
*
<POK-POK> SOUNDS as they attach and detach.
*
GIZMO
83
*
Nobody would think we’d try to 
*
sneak in this way!
*
CHRIS
84
*
Well, like Rip Redline, Master Spy 
*
always says...
*
CHRIS / GIZMO
85
*
My greatest weapon is the element 
*
of surprise.
*
CHRIS
86
*
Okay.  Let’s go spy hunting. 
*
DISSOLVE TO: 
*
EXT. RAHAB’S HOUSE - NIGHT
*
Rahab and Joy arrive from the market.  The house has a large 
*
alcove/door in front, several shuttered windows facing the 
street and on the roof will be stacks of FLAX and Flax 
plants.

 JOY
87
Rehab, you seem to know everybody 
in Jericho. 
RAHAB
88
(with a laugh)
Not nearly everybody. But I like 
people.
ANGLE PAST RAHAB - She sees the Matron standing in the portal 
of a HOME across the street.  She huffs and <SLAMS> the door.
MATRON
89
*
Hmmmgh...
*
RAHAB
90
With a few exceptions.
ANGLE FAVORING JOY - Reminded of Becky, Joy rolls her eyes.
JOY
91
I can relate to that.
(lost in thought)
There’s this girl at home, Becky?  
We’ve hardly even spoken -- but she 
acts like I’m her worst enemy.
RAHAB - nods.  Speaking from experience, she counsels:
RAHAB
92
Hmm... Sometimes people judge one 
*
another too quickly. Even if you 
*
see people a certain way, you 
*
should still give them a second 
*
chance to prove themselves.  I’m 
*
sure you and this other girl can 
find something in common -- after 
all, look at us!
TWO SHOT - Joy smiles at Rahab.  
*
WIDER ANGLE - Just then, Chris and Gizmo hurry around the 
corner.  They can see Joy by the doorway arch but don’t see 
Rahab who stands inside the door arch.
*
CHRIS
93
Joy!  We’ve been looking all over 
for you!

 GIZMO
94
And we lost track of those spies!
Chris and Gizmo pull up short when they see Rehab.
JOY
95
Can you not say that word so loud?
*
Rahab looks around, concerned.  The Matron, across the 
*
street, is peeking out her door with suspicion.
*
RAHAB
96
Come on. Everybody inside!
*
Rahab hurries Joy through the door.  Gizmo and Chris trade 
puzzled shrugs, then trail after them.
CUT TO:
INT. RAHAB'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
ESTABLISH a 'public house.  CHRIS AND GIZMO - enter, glance 
*
across the room. Gizmo blurts out...
*
GIZMO
97
Oh!  The spies!
*
Chris quickly shoves Gizmo O.C.
*
CHRIS
98
*
Giz!
*
RAHAB
99
*
WHAT?!
*
IN THE CORNER - sit the two Israelite spies.  Beside them is 
*
an indoor ladder which leads to the roof.  They keep their 
heads down, trying to look inconspicuous.
RESUME ON GROUP AT DOOR - Rahab senses imminent danger.
RAHAB (CONT’D)
100
Those are the spies? In my home?
JOY
101
Rahab, what are you going to do?
*
ZOOM IN ON RAHAB - torn between loyalty to Jericho and her 
identification with the Israelites.  Then she hears a DISTANT 
<KNOCKING> from O.S.

 A SHUTTERED WINDOW - Rahab approaches and peeks out.  The 
Captain and his Two Guards stand across the street talking 
with the Matron.  She points at Rahab’s house.
CLOSE ON RAHAB - she makes her decision and slips O.S.
IN THE CORNER - Rahab hurries over to the Spies.
RAHAB
102
You and you, up to the roof.  Go!
SPY #1
103
*
What?
*
SPY #2
104
*
What do you mean?
*
RAHAB
105
*
Go!  Now!
*
The Spies quickly stand and scamper up the nearby ladder.
THE FRONT DOOR - <BANGS> open.  The Captain and his Guards 
*
step in and scan the room with narrowed eyes.
CAPTAIN [CEV JOSHUA 2:2-3] 
106
*
Let us have the men who are staying 
at your house.  They are spies.
RAHAB
107
Spies? Oh!  Wait.  You mean them?
*
She points O.S. to...
THE TABLE - where the spies had been.  It is now occupied by

Don’t play games with me, Rahab.

And...?
RAHAB [CEV JOSHUA 2:5]
112
I don’t know where they went. If 
*
you hurry, you can probably catch 
up with them.
The Captain fixes her with a stare.  She meets his gaze.  
RACK FOCUS as the soldiers descend the ladder.  Guard #1 
shakes his head ‘no.’  RACK FOCUS to the Captain. 
CAPTAIN
113
(to the guards)
Take some men and go look for them 
at the Jordan River, where people 
cross. 
(to Rahab - warning)
We may be back.
RAHAB - bows politely as the Captain and his Guards exit.
CUT TO:
*
EXT. ROOF OF RAHAB'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The kids follow Rahab as she crosses to some FLAX PLANTS.  
She draws back a portion, REVEALING the spies hiding inside!
SPY #1
114
You saved our lives, Rahab.  Why?
CLOSE ON RAHAB - as she explains to the Spies:
RAHAB [CEV JOSHUA 2:9-12]
115
I know that the LORD has given 
Israel this land. Everyone shakes 
with fear because of you. We heard 
how the LORD dried up the Red Sea  
so you could leave Egypt. And we 
heard how you destroyed Sihon and 
Og, those two Amorite kings east of 
the Jordan River.
ANGLE ON JOY - moved as she listens.
RAHAB (NLT JOSHUA 2:11)
116
No wonder our hearts have melted in 
fear! No one has the courage to 
fight after hearing such things.

 BACK ON RAHAB
RAHAB (CONT’D)
117
For the Lord your God is the 
supreme God of the heavens above 
and the earth below.
THREE SHOT - Rahab implores the two Spies:
RAHAB [NKJV JOSHUA 2:12] 
118
Please promise me in the Lord's 
name - since I have shown you 
kindness, that you also will show 
kindness to my father’s house, and 
give me a true token, and spare my 
father, my mother, my brothers, my 
sisters, and all that they have, 
and deliver our lives from death. 
*
The Spies look to one another and nod.  Spy #1 takes her 
hand.
SPY #1 [NLT JOSHUA 2:14]
119
We offer our own lives as a 
guarantee for your safety.  
Spy#2 places his hands on theirs.
SPY#2
120
If you don’t betray us, we will 
keep our promise and be kind to you 
when the Lord gives us the land.
RAHAB - nods, eyes brimming with tears.  They suddenly hear 
*
the Guards still out on the street below.
*
RAHAB
121
*
Come.  We must hurry.
*
ANGLE ON THE KIDS - They are awed and moved by this scene.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. RAHAB'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
Rahab crosses to a window at the rear of the home, draws the 
curtains back and unhooks a RED CORD used to secure them.  
The Spies step over to face her.

122
My house is built into the city

wall.
She hands Spy #1 the cord.
RAHAB [CEV JOSHUA 2:15-16]
123
Use this cord to let yourselves 
down to the ground outside the 
wall.  
*
Spy #1 hand the cord to Spy #2, who ties one end of it to a 
metal spike in the wall (or some other stationary object).
SPY #1 [NLT JOSHUA 2:17]
124
We will be bound by the oath we 
have taken only if you follow these 
instructions.
Rahab nods.
SPY #1 [CEV JOSHUA 2:18-19]
125
You must tie this red cord on your 
window when we attack, and everyone 
in your family must be here with 
you.  We'll take the blame if 
anyone who stays in this house gets 
hurt. - But anyone who leaves your 
*
house will be killed.
CHRIS AND GIZMO - are taken aback.  This is not a game.
RAHAB - accepts the conditions.  She nods.
RAHAB
126
I understand.  Now go, before the 
Captain returns.
The Spies nod and climb out the window.
The Superbook affect appears outside the door.  The kids

sneak off towards it.

TIME SHIFT TO:
EXT. ROAD BETWEEN CAMP AT GILGAL AND JERICHO - DAY
Chris, Gizmo and Joy REAPPEAR some distance from the 
ISRAELITES' CAMP, which has moved across the Jordan.  (NEW 
ENCAMPMENT) It is now much closer to Jericho.
Gizmo checks his wrist chronometer.
*
GIZMO
129
Hmmm... It appears Superbook has

sent us forward in Time.  According 
to my chrono-spatial locator, the

Israelites have moved their camp

across the Jordan to the west side

of the River.

Closer to Jericho.

attack!

LOW ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO - (from a short distance

away.  The MARCHING SOLDIERS (famed to from knees to necks)

pass by in front of the kids.  We catch glimpses of them

through the flanks.  (This is to establish the men in front

of the Priests and not require any new models - these are all *

BLASTING -

CHRIS (O.C.)
133
*
It looks like some kind of

treasure!

FAVOR GIZMO - His face plate brings up a VISUAL SCAN (like we *
did for Moses in 105) of the Ark.  The kids lean in tp look

at his screen.

GIZMO 
134

My info-scanner is registering that

as The Ark of The Covenant.

LOW ANGLE ON SOLDIERS’ SANDALS - shuffling toward Jericho.
ANOTHER SET OF FEET - only these aren’t soldiers. GO WIDER - 
to reveal that they belong to SEVEN PRIESTS, one from each 
tribe of Israel.  And instead of weapons, the Priests carry 
RAM’S HORNS, according to the NKJV.  They bring them up to 
their mouths and blow.  The TRUMPETS’ <EERIE BLAST ECHOES> 
over the next SEVERAL SHOTS.
STILL WIDER - the first group of Israelite soldiers lead the 
way, with the Seven Priests marching behind them and blowing 
trumpets.  Another <TRUMPET BLAST>.
EVEN WIDER - More PRIESTS march behind the trumpeters.  These 
carry the ARK OF THE COVENANT on handles.  <TRUMPET BLAST>

 EXTREME HIGH DOWN SHOT - Now we see the full scope of this 
unlikely assault: a COLUMN OF SOLDIERS follows the priests as 
they slowly circumnavigate Jericho like a human river.  It is 
a strange and breathtaking sight.  [ART NOTE: their path 
keeps them at a safe distance from the wall.]  As another 
<TRUMPET BLAST> SOUNDS:
EXT. ISRAELITE CAMP - AT GILGAL - DAY (MOS)
*
As more <TRUMPETS BLAST>, DAY TWO, and another trek around 
the city, begins.
CLOSE ON FEET - the SOUND of the soldiers’ marching builds to 
a <THUNDERING BEAT> that PLAYS OVER the rest of the MONTAGE.
JOSHUA - looks on calmly as his (or rather, God’s) plan 
unfolds.  His Second steals a glance at him, less confident.
INT. RAHAB’S HOUSE - MEANWHILE - DAY (MOS)

swirls with each <THUMP> of the incessant march.

UP ANGLE ON WALL - which shakes in time to the steady <TROMP-
TROMP-TROMP> of the Israelites’ feet.  <TRUMPETS BLAST>
THE CAPTAIN - gazes down from the battlements at the line of 
people.  The Guard beside him raises his bow and arrow, 
taking aim.  The Captain stays his hand and shakes his head.
SUNRISE AGAIN - the tension continues to mount.  <TRUMPETS

HIGH DOWN SHOT - The Israelites head back to camp.

Once again, the Armies of Israel approach.

Other Guards restrain her.

VARIOUS CUTS

Joshua stands - backed by his army - looking up at the

massive wall.  SILENCE.  He turns to his assembled Armies
