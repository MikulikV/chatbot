SYNOPSIS: - On a stormy afternoon, Joy's parents' car breaks down on a 
deserted road.  Joy's called upon to help in a way she doesn't believe she 
can.   She second-guesses her own abilities and believes she's not the best 
person suited for the challenge at hand.  SUPERBOOK whisks the kids away to 
meet someone who God once chose for a very important task as well.  They 
become involved with Moses who contends he's not the best choice to lead the 
Israelites out of oppression in Egypt.  Through the course of the adventure, 
our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and 
ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. It turns out Moses was indeed the 
best choice for the plan God had for His people.  So, when Superbook returns 
the kids home, Joy takes Moses' message with her and bravely steps up to the 
challenge she faces. Leading the way, Joy calls on Chris and Gizmo's help but 
 ultimately rescues her parents and their stalled car in the middle of the  
storm. 
TAKE-AWAY: God sometimes chooses someone who may seem the least likely choice 
for a task, but they are actually the one who will carry it out the best.

FADE IN:
*
EXT. QUANTUM HOUSE - DAY (THIS SHOULD PLAY SNAPPY - 
*
QUICKLY)
*
PUSH IN on the lab from above.  We see Chris and Joy (in 
*
school uniforms) hanging out with Gizmo. Chris’ and Joy’s 
*
backpacks lie around.  Chris sits side-ways on the chair 
*
with his legs draping over the arm.  He sips a drink with 
*
a straw (Reuse from 110)  Joy stands nearby and bounces a 
*
soccer ball up and down on her alternate knees.  Gizmo 
*
stands with his back to the bookcase.  His arms are 
*
stretched across the room and he shuffles a deck of cards 
*
on the work table. - The feeling is a casual afternoon - 
*
just hanging out after school, talking about nothing. 
*
Best lists.
*
JOY
*
Okay!  Best pizza ever?
*
Chris holds up a hand with a “too easy” attitude.
*
CHRIS
*
Oh!  Easy!  Last summer.  Snack 
*
stand at the skateboard park.  The 
*
Pepperoni-Pineapple-Palooza.  
*
I ate the whole thing myself! - 
*
(shooting both 
*
forefingers at Joy)
*
Best soccer play! 
*
CLOSE ON JOY - she knees the ball up and continues to 
*
bounce it lightly up and down on her forehead as...
*
JOY
*
Second game this season.  Four 
*
seconds to go.   My incredible 
*
header! 
*
She heads the ball O.C. and throws her head back and 
*
fists in the air.
*
JOY (CONT’D)
*
GOAAAALLLLL!
*
WIDER ANGLE - The ball bounces past Gizmo and he ducks.
*
GIZMO
*
Whoa!

*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
*
Best card trick ever! Ready?
*
Joy and Chris exchange a dubious look and then turn to 
*
Gizmo.
*
GIZMO (O.C.) (CONT’D)
*
Ready?
*
BACK ON GIZMO
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)
*
All I need is 14 more decks of 
*
cards, 30 pounds of feathers and 
*
an ostrich egg.
*
BACK ON CHRIS AND JOY
*
JOY
*
Um... Gizmo, we don’t have any of 
*
those things. 
*

*
Okay then...
*
(mid air shuffle)
*
Second best card trick ever. Du-
*
oh!  We’re all out of ovrer-sized 
*
bananas and moon rocks.  Forget 
*
it.
*
The shuffle goes awry and all the cards fly.  Gizmo goes 
*
to pick them up and CAMERA ANGLES TO CHRIS as he leaps 
*
up, forefinger in the air.
*
CHRIS
*
Oh! - Best Superbook trip ever... 
*
(leaping up on the 
*
chair and going onto 
*
a “giant pose”)
*
... that had a real giant. 
*
JOY

David and Goliath! - Best 
*
Superbook trip ever...

*
I know!  The best Superbook 
*
trip... ever...
*
ON CHRIS AND JOY
*
Chris and Joy lean in and wait expectantly for him to 
*
finish so they can pounce with an answer. He doesn’t add 
*
anything. The kids’ eyes dart from one to the other. 
*
JOY
*
That had what?
*
GIZMO (O.C.)
*
Nothing.
*
BACK ON GIZMO
*
GIZMO (CONT’D)

 CHRIS
*
Wow!  Just think, Joy. Of all the 
*
times we’ve traveled with 
*
Superbook... Do you think we’ve 
*
even been on THE best, MOST 
*
important adventure there is?
*
Gizmo and Joy exchange a look.
*
JOY
*
Superbook’s greatest adventure of 
*
all time?  Hmm. Maybe we haven’t.
*
Just then the SUPERBOOK affect begins.  
*
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
*
SUPERBOOK!
*
Superbook rises from Chris backpack on the floor.  The 
*
effect envelops the three and whisks them away.
*
INT>  SUPERBOOK TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

The kids travel along.

SUPERBOOK
*
(NLT - Deuteronomy 4:32 - 
*
paraphrase)
*
I am taking you to see such 
*
things, that if you “searched all 
*
of history, from the time God 
*
created people on the earth until 
*
now, and searched from one end of 
*
the heavens to the other.... you 
*
would know nothing as great as 
*
this has ever been seen or heard 
*
before.  
*
(direct scripture for 
*
ref.)
*
Deuteronomy 4:32“ - Now search all 
*
of history, from the time God 
*
created people on the earth until 
*
now, and search from one end of 
*
the heavens to the other. Has 
*
anything as great as this ever 
*
been seen or heard before?

 <BLEATING SFX> - Suddenly, Chris, Joy and Gizmo 
materialize in mid-air - behind him and fall into a large 
stack of hay.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO 
(descending screams into impact)
Just as they vanish into the pile of hay - Moses tilts 
his head and sees the hay stack “jumping and thrashing.”
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO (CONT’D)
(Struggling efforts)
ANGLE BEHIND THE HAYSTACK - OUT OF SIGHT OF MOSES
Chris, Joy and Gizmo struggle out - remaining low on 
their hands and knees - sending sheep scattering. 
<BLEATING SFX>. 
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO (CONT’D)
(coughing/wheezing)
 Gizmo consults his wrist chrono-meter.
GIZMO
My geo-sensors indicate we are in 
the land of Midian, in the year... 
Before he can finish, Moses peers around the haystack 
while the last remaining sheep SCATTER O.C.
MOSES
Well, well, what have we here?  
*
Are you travelers who have lost 
*
your way? 
*
GIZMO
*
Um... we have not lost our way.  I 
*
am programmed to...oh-mm...I 
*
mean...eh... that is to say... 
*
uh... do you know that you have 
*
some fine hay here.
*
JOY

And here...

 MOSES
*
I am Moses. And, forgive me, but 
*
it appears I had better herd those

runaways back to my flock. 
He quickly EXITS FRAME -

CAMERA PANS THE LANDSCAPE as we hear...
MOSES (O.C.)
Thank you for your help, children.
Moses, Chris, Joy and Gizmo come INTO VIEW.
CHRIS
This is really amazing country.  
Have you lived here long, Moses?
MOSES
*
For a good number of years I have 
*
lived in Midian.
*
GIZMO
*
Well... Where did you live before 
*
this?
*
MOSES
*
I lived in Egypt.
*
ON MOSES - PUSH IN as he remembers...

the Pharaoh.

Yes. But it was in the time of the 
*
old Pharaoh. 
*
FLASHBACK:
*
EXT. ANCIENT EGYPT - A MASSIVE STONE STOREHOUSE – EXTREME 
*
WIDE SHOT - DAY
*
A gigantic unfinished STOREHOUSE towers against the sky.  
*
Wooden scaffolds rise up the sides. <WHIP-CRACKING>, 
*
<HAMMERS>, <CHISELS>  Slaves work hard in the sun.
*
MOSES (V.O.)
*
Though I was raised an Egyptian I 
*
am Hebrew by birth.
*
YOUNG MOSES watches all.  He's a tall, strong young man, 
*
dressed as a Prince of Egypt - but we see the 
*
resemblance. There is a WHIP CRACK  Moses turns to see An 
*
EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER, <CRACKS> his whip at a slave.
*
CLOSE ON ONE SLAVE
*
He stumbles and falls to his knees.  The Task Master 
*
ENTERS FRAME LARGE ABOVE and raises his whip.  The slave 
*
cowers down.
*
MOSES  (VO)
*
Once, I came across an Egyptian 
*
Taskmaster beating a slave.  
*
CLOSE ON THE TASKMASTER'S RAISED ARM
*
From nowhere, a strong HAND intervenes, grabbing the 
*
Taskmaster's raised whip arm from behind.
*
MOSES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
*
I tried to stop his hand.
*
PULL BACK TO REVEAL…
*
Young Moses whirls the man around, stopping him from 
*
beating the slave. The Taskmaster angrily fights back, 
*
trying to free his arm.
*
MOSES (V.O.) (CONT’D)
*
But he struggled... and I struck 
*
him down.  
*
ANGLE TO THE WALL
*
SB#104 "The Perfect Choice" - REV-ANICON 4-7-12   8.

 We see in shadow on the wall as Moses raises his mighty 
*
hand to the Taskmaster and <STRIKES> him down.
*
DISSOLVE BACK 
*
TO REALITY:
*
EXT. MOUNT HOREB - CONTINUOUS (REAL TIME)
*
MOSES (CONT’D)
*
That was another lifetime.
*
Here in Midian I found refuge. And 
*
for many years I have lived 
*
happily, raising my family, and 
*
tending my herds.
*
GIZMO
*
And all the slaves were freed, 
*
right?
*
CLOSER ON MOSES - He turns and looks at Gizmo with a sad 
*
demeanor.
*
MOSES
*
Sadly, no.  My people still toil 
*
in bondage. But now they bow to a 
*
new Pharaoh who is even more 
*
cruel.
*
Moses stops and looks past the kids as he spots something 
*
strange in the distance. 
*
GOD (O.S.)
*
(quietly)
*
Moses... 
*
THE CAMERA PANS AROUND THE ROCKY LANDSCAPE TO REVEAL A 
BUSH ON FIRE.
The green bush is ablaze with an other-worldly glow.
*
THE CAMERA CUTS TO A SHOT FROM BEHIND THE BUSH.  WE SEE 
MOSES APPROACHING AND THE KIDS WATCHING FROM BEHIND A 
LARGE ROCK.
As Moses, his shepherd staff in hand, nears the Burning 
Bush, a VOICE speaks to him.
GOD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Moses...  Moses...
Moses reacts, a bit startled.

 MOSES
Here I am.
CAMERA CUTS TO A LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP AT THE BUSH FROM 
BEHIND MOSES.
GOD (O.S.)
Do not draw near this place.  Take 
your sandals off your feet for the 
place you stand is holy ground.
CLOSE ON A ROCK
The kids and Gizmo peek out from behind the rock.  They 
watch in bewilderment.  
ON MOSES
He has removed his sandals. He looks in awe at the bush 
and drops to his knees.
GOD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I am the God of your father -- the 
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, 
and the God of Jacob.  I am who I 
*
am.
*
His eyes widen in fear, and he covers his face as the 
bush flairs.
ON KIDS
The kids watch from behind the rock.
CHRIS
(whispers to Joy)
Is Moses… talking to a plant?
JOY
Shhhh……
JOY (CONT’D)
Look! The bush is on fire but it’s 
*
not burning up. 
ANGLE ON BURNING BUSH AND CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL OTS   
OF MOSES.
Moses stands reverently before the Bush.
GOD (CEV)
I have seen how my people are 
suffering as slaves in Egypt.

 CAMERA WRAPS AROUND PUSHES IN EXTREMELY CLOSE ON MOSES 
as...
GOD (CEV) (CONT’D)
And I have heard them beg for My 
help because of the way they are 
being mistreated.  I feel sorry 
for them.
GOD (NLT) (CONT’D)
Now go. For I am sending you to 
the Pharaoh.  
CU OF BURNING BUSH
GOD (CONT’D)
You must lead my people, Israel, 
out of Egypt.
CLOSE ON - Moses eyes open - taken aback as he stands to 
his feet.
MOSES (CEV)
(small gasp... stammering) ...but 
Who am I to go to the king...
... and lead your people out of 
Egypt?
TWO SHOT - MOSES AND THE BURNING BUSH (CAMERA IS BEHIND 
THE BUSH FACING MOSES)
MOSES (CONT’D)
The Pharaoh is a harsh and Godless 
man. Why would he listen to me?
CAMERA BEGINS TO PUSH THROUGH THE FIRE AND CLOSE ON 
MOSES.
GOD (CEV)
I will be with you.  And you will 
know that I am the one who sent 
you when you worship me on this 
mountain after you have led my 
people out of Egypt.
CLOSE ON THE KIDS AND GIZMO
PAN ACROSS THEIR FACES, from Gizmo to Joy to Chris, 
watching.
MOSES (O.S.)(NKJV) 
But... but... suppose they will 
*
not believe me or, or listen to my

voice.

MS ON MOSES
Moses looks at the staff in his hand.
MOSES (NLT)

CLOSE ON THE GROUND
The staff ENTER FRAME - hits the ground - <THUD> - and 
suddenly morphs into a LARGE <HISSING> SERPENT.
CLOSE ON GIZMO AND THE KIDS - They flinch back in fear.
CHRIS/JOY/GIZMO
(gasps of fear and “whoas” 
of surprise)
MOSES
(small gasp)
GIZMO 
Did you see that?!  I must ask  
Moses to teach me that one!
ON MOSES.
*
GOD
*
Reach out your hand and take it by 
*
the tail.

Moses does as he’s told.  The snake transforms back into

a staff.
THE CAMERA IS PUSHING IN ON MOSES.

 MOSES (NLT)
(hesitantly)
*
Oh Lord, I’m not very good with 
words.  I never have been, and I’m 
not now, even though you have 
spoken to me.  I get tongue tied, 
and my words get tangled.
CLOSE ON MOSES
GOD (NLT)
Who makes a person’s mouth? 
OTS OF MOSES ON BURNING BUSH.  CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE 
BURNING BUSH AND GOD SPEAKS.
Who decides whether people speak 
or do not speak, hear or do not 
hear, see or do not see? Is it not 
I, the Lord?  
GOD (CEV) (CONT’D)
Now go!  
CLOSE ON MOSES
GOD (CONT’D)
When you speak, I will be with you 
and give you the words to say.
Moses nods -- but he looks worried.

He asked me to come meet you. 
WS OF MOSES AND AARON IN THE FOREGROUND AND THE KIDS IN 
THE BACKGROUND.  AS AARON AND MOSES TALK THE CAMERA 
PUSHES INTO JOY.
Moses loses some of his energy and drops his head 
slightly.
MOSES
God has told me to go to Egypt and 
free our people. I fear I will not 
be able to do what the Lord is 
requesting of me.
The kids look on in concern.

Aaron not too powerful - but enough to be heard.
AARON (NKJV)
Oh mighty Pharaoh…  Thus says the 
Lord God of Israel: "Let My people 
go, that they may hold a feast to 
Me in the wilderness."
CU ON PHARAOH
Startled at the presumption.  Then, haughtily:
PHARAOH (CEV)
Who is this lord and why should I 
obey him? 
Pharaoh rises, imperiously.  He steps off camera in their

still the best adventure with a 
*
giant!  
*
He leaps up on the chair.  Joy gets what he’s thinking 
*
and grabs the pointer, spinning it like a Samurai.
*
JOY
*
And another with flaming swords!

*
(slowly getting it)
*
Yes!  So, that means there will 
*
still be lots more adventures.  I 
*
cannot wait! - Du-oh.  Did I say 
*
that?
*
Chris leaps off the chair, diving for the backpack and he 
*
goes tearing into it.
*
CHRIS
*
We gotta find Superbook and get 
*
him to take us on new adventure.
*
Joy races over and starts going through the file cabinet.
*
Gizmo goes to the bookcase and raises his head and 
*
stretches his arms.  He pulls a book out of either end of 
*
the bookcase and scans the shelf behind each section. 
*
GIZMO
*
Superbook, where are you?!
*
The kids scramble around the lab, looking in, under and 
*
around all objects as the CAMERA PULLS OUT HIGH AND WIDE
*
JOY
*
Where is Superbook.  You can never 
*
find him.  
*
CHRIS
*
He just comes when he wants to.  
*
GIZMO
*
Hey... Superbook...
*
FADE OUT:
