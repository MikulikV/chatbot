CAMERA SLOWLY takes in an ESTABLISHING SHOT...
INT. CITADEL OF SUSA - DAY
Hanani stand by a window.  Nehemiah hurries to him.   
They speak in hushed tones so as not to be overheard in 
the palace. 
NEHEMIAH
1
My brother, what can you tell me 
about the Jews who escaped 
captivity in Babylon?  And how are 
things going Jerusalem? 
HANANI 
2
Those captives who have come back 
are having all kinds of troubles.  
They are terribly disgraced. 
PUSH IN ON NEHEMIAH
HANANI (CONT’D)
3
Jerusalem’s walls are broken down 
and its gates have been burned. 
(Nehemiah 1:3 NLT). 
He sits down and cries.
 NEHEMIAH

(Weeping) - Lord God of heaven, I 
am your servant, so please have 
mercy on me. (Nehemiah 1:6 CEV)

EXT. JERUSALEM - FOUNTAIN GATE - NIGHT 
CAMERA PULLS OUT FROM NEHEMIAH’S EYE  We FIND Nehemiah is 
riding a donkey around the city’s destroyed walls.  
NEHEMIAH (V.O)
5
I, my family and the rest of your 
people have sinned by choosing to 
disobey you and the teachings of 
Moses. (Nehemiah 1:6-7)
Three men walk behind him.  Nehemiah stops and Dismounts 
as he surveys the ruins all around him.  
NEHEMIAH (V.O) (CONT’D)
6
But you also said we could return 
to you and start obeying you.  
Then you would bring us back to 
the place where you have chosen to 
be worshiped. (Nehemiah 1:9 CEV).
Nehemiah squats down and picks up a burned stone that has 
fallen from the desecrated wall.  
NEHEMIAH (CONT’D)
7
Please answer my prayer. (Nehemiah 
1:10 CEV). 
CLOSER ON NEHEMIAH - a tear forms in the corner of his 
eye.  PUSH in on burned stone in his hands. Off the 
darkened stone we...

EXT. JERUSALEM - VALLEY GATE - NIGHT
Nehemiah stands by his donkey, on a broken section of the 
wall, speaking to a small crowd of PRIESTS, NOBLES, 
OFFICIALS and other JEWS. (Nehemiah 2:17 NKJV). 
NEHEMIAH
8
God has granted my prayer and let 
me return here to Jerusalem. Just 
as he has let your tribes return.

 EXT. OUTSIDE THE WALLS - WITH A VIEW IN
SHEMIAH is with SANBALLAT, the governor of Samaria and 
TOBIAH, the Ammonite official. 
SHEMAIAH
9
Governor Sanballat, Nehemiah is 
stirring up the people, saying 
they can rebuild the wal of 
Jerusalem.
Sanballat brandishes a LETTER (clay tablet).
SANBALLAT
10
I know. He gave me this letter 
from the king granting him safe 
passage to Judah.
CLOSER ON SANBALLAT - his eyes full of anger as he reads.
SANBALLAT (CONT’D)
11
(scoffing)
It even says I am to give him 
timber for this crazy idea.
WIDER - favoring Tobiah.
TOBIAH
12
If he succeeds, and they rebuild 
the wall and gates, we will lose 
control of the city. 
Sanballat steps forward with a keen eye and watches the 
O.C. Action.
SANBALLAT’S POV
ANGLE CROWD - intently listening, nodding. 
NEHEMIAH (V.O.)
13
Come, let us rebuild the wall of 
Jerusalem so that we won’t 
continue to be in disgrace! 
(Nehemiah 1:17-18 NKJV).
The crowd murmurs at first - is it even possible? 
CROWD

 SANBALLAT
15
He is a dreamer. A few might 
listen to him but not... 
Shemaiah moves in and cuts him off.
SHEMAIAH
16
They already are, Sanballat!
Suddenly, a CHEER goes up O.S.  They turn to look

Sanballat steps IN CALLING OUT...
SANBALLAT
18
(mocking)
What are you doing?  Are you 
rebelling against the 
king?(Jeremiah 2:19 CEV)
ON NEHEMIAH
NEHEMIAH
19
The God of heaven will give us 
success!  As God’s servants we 
will start building.  But you will 
have no share, right, or claim in 
Jerusalem. (Jeremiah 2:19 CEV)
CROWD

<CHEER>
TRACKING CLOSE ON SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH as they whirl and 
angrily move out of the city.  
SANBALLAT

I promise you, Tobiah, Nehemiah 
will never complete this task.

FADE TO BLACK.
                       ACT ONE
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
Part classroom, part lab with beakers and chemicals on 
shelves.  Chris and Gizmo set up an experiment.  
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             4
 Both wear safety goggles. Chris light pushes a button and 
ignites the bunsen burner.  Gizmo is pours purple liquid 
back and forth between two beakers. 
CLOSE ON GIZMO - pouring the chemical into a beaker. He 
looks up and speaks to someone OFF.
CHRIS
22
I’m not sure I can do this, Mrs. 
Crawford.
WIDER - MRS. CRAWFORD, the science teacher (REUSE Science 
Teacher from episode 203) heads out.
MRS. CRAWFORD
23
You can this, Chris.  I have faith 
you.  And Gizmo. 
Mrs. Crawford exits as Joy approaches the open door with 
her backpack on. She has overheard and stops at the door.
JOY
24
What exactly does Mrs. Crawford 
think you two Einsteins can do?  
CHRIS
25
She’s got a teacher’s meeting and 
she wants me tutor a couple of 
students.
JOY
26
You?  Tutor who?
CHRIS
27
Yeah me. Tutor Todd and Benjie. 
FAVOR GIZMO
He picks up a spoon and stirs the purple liquid in one of 
the beakers.
GIZMO
28
Yes!  They told Mrs. Crawford that 
with a little extra help they 
think they could have “bright 
futures in science!”  
The sound of SKATEBOARDS scraping the floor.  Joy looks 
O.C. at unseen students approaching down the hall.
TODD AND BENJIE (O.C.)
29
(laughing and goofing)
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             5
 JOY
30
Yeah, and uh... good luck with 
that. 
She ducks away from the door and heads off just as .  
TODD (reuse) and BENJIE (Philippino) both skateboard in 
and around the desks in the room. 
BENJIE
31
We’re ready, Professor Nerd, sir.
They skateboard up to the bunsen burner on the table.  
Gizmo stands beside it with the beaker with spoon 
sticking out. Benjie takes the beaker from him.
BENJIE (CONT’D)
32
Hey, what’s for dinner.
CHRIS
33
Come on, guys.  The class is 
chemistry not cooking.
BENJIE
34
What the difference?
Benjie lifts the spoon from the liquid to inspect it. 
Gizmo grabs the beaker and spoon away.
GIZMO
35
In chemistry you never lick the 
spoon.
BENJIE
36
Oooo, science talk.  I just felt 
my I.Q. go up. 
Gizmo rolls his eyes and shakes his head.
GIZMO
37
Yet another child left behind.
Todd suddenly raps a fist on top of Gizmo’s head and his 
top hatch pops open. 
TODD
38
Hey, let’s see what happens if 
this chemical compound is dumped 
inside a talking tin can.
Gizmo throws a forefinger in the air,
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             6
 GIZMO
39
Excuse me. You mock us for 
helping, and you undoubtedly have 
a lifetime of other bad decisions 
ahead of you. Allow me to 
interrupt this one.  
Just then, Chris swoops in and grabs the beaker away.  
GIZMO (CONT’D)
40
Quit it, Todd!  You wanna fry his 
circuits?! 
TODD
41
Okay!  
BENJIE
42
(mocking tone)
You heard the professor!  No 
frying! This isn’t cooking class! 
TOOD AND BENJIE 
<LAUGH>
CHRIS
Come on, Gizmo.  These two 
don’t want to learn. We’re 
outta here.
WIDER - Chris and Gizmo for the door.  
TODD
43
Aw Quantum. We’re just having fun.
BENJIE
44
Come back! We’11 sing the periodic 
chart!
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS as Chrs and Gizmo charge towards 
camera.  We hear todd and Benjie singing the periodic 
chart, fading in the BG.
TODD AND BENJIE (O.C.)

Boron and carbon and calcium, 
cobalt, and radium, zinc, titanium 
too. Silver and tungsten and iron 
and lead. Strontium, calcium...

 EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON
As Chris and Gizmo exit the school and storm down the 
front steps. Joy rushes up.
JOY
46
Wow. They must have been fast 
learners.  
CLOSER ON GIZMO AND CHRIS - turning to Joy.
CHRIS
47
I tried to help them and all they 
did was make fun of me, Joy!  I 
don’t need this!  
JOY
48
Chris, come on.  A little mocking 
and teasing you blow your top?!  
CHRIS
49
I got just two things to say! I 
quit!
JOY
50
That’s one thing.
CHRIS
51
OKAY JOY! I’M BETTER AT SCIENCE 
THAN MATH! 
<THE SUPERBOOK SOUND EFFECT> is heard. 
CLOSE UP ON SUPERBOOK as it rises from Joy’s pocket.
CHRIS, JOY & GIZMO

I am taking you to meet a man who 
overcame mocking and danger to 
complete an important task God. 
EXT. JERUSALEM WALL - DAY
The kids and Gizmo land near a section of the ruined 
wall, rubble all around them.  Gizmo’s screen lights up.
JOY
56
Where are we, Giz?
GIZMO
57
According to my geo sensors, we 
have landed in ancient Jerusalem.  
CHRIS 
58
Or what’s left of it... 
The kids look up to see --  
ANGLE NEHEMIAH AND HANANI - Hanani reading from a list.
HANANI
59
The high priest Eliashib will 
rebuild the Sheep Gate.  Joida and 
Meshulla will restore the Ancient 
Gate.  (Nehemiah 3:3 CEV).
ANGLE KIDS AND GIZMO - watching the brothers.
GIZMO 
60
They must be doing major repairs. 
JOY
61
It sure could use a makeover. 
WIDER ANGLE - as Nehemiah and Hanani approach the trio. 
NEHEMIAH
62
Let’s see, which part of the wall 
were you three assigned to repair?   
Hanani checks his list.
ANGLE FAVORING JOY - covering.
JOY
63
Ah... we’re probably not on that 
list.  We’re new here.
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             9
 CHRIS
64
Chris, Joy and Gizmo.
WIDER FAVORING NEHEMIAH - who smiles at them.
NEHEMIAH
65
Nehemiah.  And truth be told, I 
haven’t been here long myself. 
ANGLE FAVORING KIDS - impressed.
CHRIS
66
And you’re already running the 
place?  You must have major 
connections.
NEHEMIAH
67
I suppose you could say that.  
Nehemiah looks out across the broken down wall.  We see a 
good view of it in daylight.
NEHEMIAH (CONT’D)
68
God sent me to repair this wall 
and bring my people back to Him. 
JOY
69
God?  Okay, I’d say that’s about 
as good as connected as you can 
get.  
CHRIS
70
You said you were sent here?  From 
where?
ANGLE FAVORING NEHEMIAH 
NEHEMIAH
71
Well... I was a servant in Persia 
for King Artaxerxes when my 
brother, Hanani, told me about the 
terrible state of Jerusalem. 
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. BANQUET HALL - COURT OF KING ARTAXERXES - DAY
Nehemiah serves the KING and QUEEN wine.
NEHEMIAH (V.O.)
72
I prayed to God to help me 
convince the king to let me come 
here.  
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             10
 As he speaks, WE SEE but do not hear him kneel before the 
king and ask permission to leave his service.
NEHEMIAH (V.O.)
73
The king could have become angry, 
but God touched his heart. 
The king kindly puts a hand on Nehemiah’s shoulder.
END FLASH BACK
EXT. JERUSALEM - DAY
The group, as before.  Except now WORKERS are arriving 
with tools to repair the wall and nearby gate.
NEHEMIAH
74
He granted me permission and even 
sent soldiers with me. (Nehemiah 
2:2-6 CEV)
ANGLE KIDS 
Gizmo whirls toward the wall his screen lighting up 
taking measurements.
GIZMO
75
Well, it looks like you could use 
some help!  And it appears we will 
need four beams and seventy-three 
stones to fix this particular 
section of wall. 
ANGLE FAVORING NEHEMIAH - who is delighted.
NEHEMIAH
76
Then this is yours to repair.  If 
all my workers are as smart as you 
we will complete our job in no 
time.
Suddenly they hear DERISIVE LAUGHTER OFF and turn.
SANBALLAT (V.O.)
77
<DERISIVE LAUGHING>
ANGLE SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH as they approach. 
SANBALLAT
78
You, Nehemiah?  What do you know 
about rebuilding a city?     
(calling to workers)
You are all wasting your time.
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             11
 ANGLE TOBIAH - points to a part of the wall mid-repair.
TOBIAH
79
Look at the wall they are 
building!  Why, even a fox could 
knock over this pile of stones! 
(Nehemiah 4:2-3 CEV).
Tobiah pushes a stone and a whole section of recently 
repaired wall collapses.  
CLOSER ANGLE - Nehemiah he closes his eyes and pryas 
quietly.  Chris and Joy watch.  
NEHEMIAH
80
Hear us, our God, for we are being 
mocked. May their scoffing fall 
back on their own heads, and may 
they themselves become captives in 
a foreign land! Do not ignore 
their guilt. Do not blot out their 
sins, for they have provoked you 
to anger here in front of the 
builders. (Nehemiah 4:4-5)
Sanballat grows angry because Nehemiah is not reacting to 
his taunts but is praying instead.  He lean into 
Nehemiah. 
SANBALLAT
81
You’re a fool. You will never 
complete this wall!
WIDER ANGLE 
Sanballat and Tobiah exit. Nehemiah turns to the workers.
NEHEMIAH
82
Sanballat is trying to stop us 
from taking our city back.  But 
are we going to let him?
ANGLE WORKERS - they suddenly stand more upright.
WORKERS
83
NO!! (into a cheer)
ANGLE WORKERS - returning to their work, energized. 
ANGLE CHRIS AND JOY - as they get back to work.
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             12
 JOY
84
(impressed)
Did you see how Nehemiah stood up 
to those men?  
CHRIS
85
Yeah... well... it helps to have a 
whole nation on your side. 
JOY
86
A nation or no nation. It’s about 
what you do, Chris.
Joy heads off as Chris thinks about this.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. JERUSALEM - OUTSIDE THE CITY WALL - DAY (TIME LATER)
Sanballat and Tobiah watch as men on the wall toil away.  
TOBIAH
87
Look at them.  Working just as 
hard as before.  Nehemiah seems to 
be inspiring all the Jews. 
SANBALLAT
88
Before they know what’s happening, 
we will swoop down on them and 
kill them and end their work.”He 
cannot inspire them if he is dead. 
(Nehemiah 4:11 NLT)
As the men head off REVEAL -- 
GIZMO AND CHRIS BEHIND A STACK OF RUBBLE 
They’ve got an arm full of stones.  
CHRIS
89
Whoa... did you hear that?  Come 
on!
They drop the stones and take off.
EXT. JERUSALEM - ANOTHER PART OF THE WALL - DAY
Joy works with Nehemiah making mortar from mud. 
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             13
 JOY
90
I haven’t played with mud since I 
was a little kid. I forgot how fun 
it was! 
Suddenly Chris and Gizmo rush IN, out of breath.
CHRIS
91
Nehemiah!  Gizmo and I just 
overheard Sanballat plotting to 
attack!
CLOSE ANGLE - Nehemiah.  He nods grimly. 
NEHEMIAH
92
I know.  At least ten others have 
warned me of this coming attack. 
But where... and when?
Suddenly, a man yells from the wall.
MAN (V.O.)
93
Soldiers approaching!
ANGLE TOP OF WALL - where the MAN points to the plain 
beyond.
ANGLE BEHIND NEHEMIAH AND THE KIDS 
They look through a break in the wall to see a GROUP OF 
SOLDIERS riding toward them lead by Sanballat and Tobiah.
ANGLE GIZMO - shrinking down.
GIZMO
94
Retreat!
He scurries behind a pot.  
ANGLE NEHEMIAH, JOY AND CHRIS
Nehemiah calmly watches the oncoming soldiers as Chris 
watches, nervous.
CHRIS
95
Soldiers against carpenters. I 
don’t like our odds.
NEHEMIAH
96
Don’t be afraid of the enemy. 
Remember the Lord, who is great 
and glorious.(Nehemiah 4:14 NLT). 
CLOSER ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY - wide-eyed, scared.
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             14
 ANGLE SOLDIERS - charging toward the wall.  
FADE OUT.
                                       
                         ACT TWO
EXT. OUTSIDE JERUSALEM WALL - DAY
Sanballat, Tobiah and the soldiers on horseback race 
toward the wall. 
EXT. - INSIDE WALL - 
Chris, Joy, and Nehemiah watch, wide-eyed.
CHRIS 
97
Nehemiah, I was thinking, maybe we 
should, you know, run now?
ANGLE FAVORING GIZMO BEHIND POT 
GIZMO 
98
Good idea!
The pot starts to back away.  
ANGLE FAVORING NEHEMIAH - who turns to a MAN behind him.
NEHEMIAH
99
Signal the men!
The man pulls out a ram’s horn and blows it loudly.
WIDE ANGLE WORKERS ALONG THE WALL - they hear the 
<TRUMPETING>.  
CLOSER ANGLE TWO MEN - who put down their tools and reach 
under a cloth and pull out swords and shields.
ANGLE ON ANOTHER THREE MEN - who are putting on armor and 
brandishing bows and arrows. 
WIDER ON WALL - where half the men are showing weapons.  
The others keep working.
ANGLE CHRIS, JOY, AND GIZMO - Gizmo pops up and sees the 
armed men. 
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             15
 GIZMO
100
Okay, so maybe we don’t run. 
JOY
101
If anyone’s gonna run, it’s gonna 
be Sanballat.  
EXT. JERUSALEM - OUTSIDE WALL - CONTINUOUS
Sanballat, Tobiah, and the soldiers come to a sudden 
halt.  
ON SANBALLAT AND TOBIAH as they scan the wall that is now 
heavily guarded.
TOBIAH
102
(under his breath)
We’re outnumbered.  Look!  
POV
SLOWLY PAN the wall under construction... but higher than 
we have yet seen it.  The workers stand shoulder to 
shoulder with weapons ready.
CAMERA DROPS PUSHES IN BETWEEN TWO WORKERS WITH SWORDS 
and the camera jibs down behind the wall, continuing 
along and more workers come and go, continuing to build 
and make bricks.  Nothing will stop them.
CLOSE ON THE KIDS
They look out - waiting - wondering what Sanballat will 
do.
CLOSE ON NEHEMIAH
He looks out - waiting - KNOWING what they will do.
ON SANBALLAT
He hesitates a beat... and then calls angrily to his men.
SANBALLAT
103
Fall back!  Fall back!
ANGLE WIDENS as Sanballat, Tobiah and the soldiers 
retreat.  
CLOSE ON SANBALLAT - who stops and turns back for a 
moment, giving Nehemiah an ominous “I’ll be back” look. 
Then he turns and charges away.

 EXT. JERUSALEM - WALL - CONTINUOUS
Chris, Joy, and Gizmo cheer.  
KIDS
104
<CHEER>
CHRIS
105
That was awesome!  You really 
showed them, Nehemiah.
CLOSER ON NEHEMIAH 
NEHEMIAH
106
Show no fear.  That is the only 
way to deal with men like 
Sanballat. 
He turns to the WORKERS close by.
NEHEMIAH (CONT’D)
107
We must work quickly!  As long as 
there are open gates, we are 
vulnerable to attack!  
ANGLE GIZMO - quickly picking up bricks. 
GIZMO
108
Well then by all means, let’s get 
these gates closed! 
FAVORING CHRIS - as he leans over to Joy.
CHRIS
109
Not only does this guy stand up to 
bullies, he has a plan to defeat 
them.
CLOSE ON CHRIS - as he takes that in.
EXT. JERUSALEM - DAY - LATER
CLOSE ON GIZMO - placing a mud-formed brick onto the arm-
platter in his opened stomach.  There is already one 
brick on the arm platter.
GIZMO
110
So, what I am thinking is that if 
we manufactured our own perfectly 
scaled bricks, the wall would go 
up much faster. 
The chest plate closes.
                      SB - Nehemiah - REC Draft 11-14-12             17
 JOY
111
Gizmo, we can’t use bricks in the 
wall of Jerusalem.  
GIZMO
112
Just wait... It is almost a 
hundred degrees outside and over 
five hundred inside!
THUD-THUD he taps his chest. A beat... then <DING> His 
chest pops open and the arm-platter extends with two 
perfectly baked bricks.  The arm flicks and the pops as 
the bricks flip up in the air.  Gizmo catches one in each 
hand.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
113
Step right up. Get your bricks 
here!  Hot and fresh!
Gizmo turns and places them on a section of the wall.
ANGLE FAVORING CHRIS AND GIZMO as Chris helps Gizmo hoist 
another brick into his stomach.
CHRIS 
114
Gizmo, we’re wasting time with 
this.  We should all get back to 
the stones and finish before 
Sanballat and his soldiers come 
back.
ON GIZMO - eyes widen, reacting to this thought.
GIZMO
115
No!  No!  Give me a chance!  I can 
turn the heat up and cook twice as 
fast. 
Gizmo crams two more bricks into the his “oven” and SLAMS 
it shut.  He suddenly begins to comically overheat. His 
body expands and steam begins to <SHUSSHH> out of his 
joints.  His chest door <THWAPS> opened and closed as 
flames shoot out around the edges.  His face plate 
displays a Yule log Burning and <CRACKLING> loudly, while 
a steam whistle shoots out of the top of his head and 
gives a long <STEAM WHISTLE SFX.
JOY

Tobiah pounds his fist on the table in anger.
TOBIAH

He must be stopped. 
Sanballat leaps up in anger. 
SANBALLAT

You don’t think I know that?!
He strides to the window and leans on the still - arms 
stretched before him - weary with the failures.

No fear of us perhaps.

Let’s hurry to the holy place of 
the temple and hide there. We will 
lock the temple doors, because 
your enemies are planning to kill 
you tonight.” (Nehemiah 6:10 CEV).
Nehemiah frees himself as he says...
NEHEMIAH
165
Why should someone like me have to 
run and hide in the temple to save 
my life?  I won’t go. (Nehemiah 
6:11 CEV).

have done.
