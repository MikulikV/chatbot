Animatic Conformed Draft 4-7-12
SYNOPSIS: Chris is having an argument with his mother, Phoebe, and 
he's displaying some 12 year old disrespect for her wishes.  
SUPERBOOK appears, and in a very special episode, takes Chris, 
Joy, Gizmo AND Phoebe back in time, for an encounter with Jesus' 
mother Mary at a most trying time - her son's crucifixion.  During 
the astounding events that unfold - Jesus' appearance before 
Pilat, the journey up Calvary, the Crucifixion and finally the 
glory of the resurrection - Chris witnesses Mary's devotion to her 
son and Jesus' love for His mother even when fulfilling His part 
in God's plan for mankind.  Chris' respect for his mother grows as 
he watches her with Mary.  When Superbook finally returns the 
family to present day, Phoebe, miraculously, has no recollection 
of the journey, but Chris, however, is a changed son.  He 
apologizes for their argument and acquiesces to her wishes to 
attend a family function rather than a concert with his friends.
TAKE-AWAY: The relationship between a mother and son is to be 
honored.

Man with a kiss?

given me?

 JOHN
19
But my Lord --
JESUS (NKJV LUKE 22:51)
20
Permit even this.
Jesus turns to face the Mob. ANGLE WIDENS  TO INCLUDE PRIESTS 
- HIGHLIGHT Nahshon.  The UNDULATING LIGHT from TORCHES and 
LANTERNS plays across their faces.
JESUS (O.S.) (NKJV 22:52) (CONT’D)

Have you come out, as against a 
robber, with swords and clubs?

Aw, Mom, Uncle Stan's so -- boring!
PHOEBE - counts her fingers as she recites:

He's your uncle. He's in town for 
one night.  And he's looking

don't think that's asking too much.

you, young man!
CUT TO:

Every time I make plans, my mom

JOY
43
It's okay, Mrs. Quantum!  Hang on!
PHOEBE
44
(freaked)
What's happening?!
The kids take Phoebe's hands to steady her.  She settles for 
a beat -- then startles again as she hears:
SUPERBOOK (V.O.)
45
Be strong and of good courage; do 
not fear nor be dismayed.
PHOEBE
46
(gasp) Who said that?!
CHRIS
47
Relax, Mom, that's Superbook.  It's 
taking us back in time.

The nickel drops.  Phoebe looks from one to the other.
PHOEBE
48
What are you talking about?!
(realizing)
You sound like you've done this 
before!
CHRIS - enjoys having the upper hand on his mom.
CHRIS
49
Sure.  Lots!  Whenever Superbook 
wants to show us something, off we

FADE.
PHOEBE
53
<startled gasp>
REVERSE PAST PHOEBE AND THE TRAVELERS - standing at the BACK 
OF A CROWD that fills the huge SQUARE.  In B.G. is the 
PRAETORIUM, the seat of power for the Roman Occupation.  A 
broad SET OF STAIRS lead to a top-level BALCONY.  Behind 
that, inside, there is a GREAT HALL (which we'll see later).

REVERSE ON TRAVELERS - as they trade puzzled looks.
PHOEBE

teach love!
Phoebe looks concerned, then gestures at her surroundings.
PHOEBE
65

Leaning against the interior wall, she groans:

REVERSE - as Mother Mary steps INTO A SHAFT OF LIGHT.
MOTHER MARY
76
Who is it that you seek?
PHOEBE crosses INTO SHOT and slumps, exhausted.

My son.  I've lost him!
MOTHER MARY - looks at Phoebe with a kind, sad expression.
MOTHER MARY
78
As have I.  Only...
REVERSE ANGLE PAST MOTHER MARY - out to the street.  In B.G., 
rising above the low buildings we see the Praetorium.  She

Are you the King of the Jews?
EXT. PILATE'S CHAMBER - MEANWHILE - MORNING
PONTIUS PILATE leans INTO a TIGHT TWO SHOT beside Jesus.
JESUS (CEV JOHN 18:34)
84
Are you asking this on your own or 
did someone tell you about me?
PILATE (CEV JOHN 18:35)
85
Your own people and the chief 
priests brought you to me.  What 
have you done?
JESUS (NKJV JOHN 18:36)
86
My kingdom is not of this world.  
PILATE
87
Are You a king, then?
JESUS (NLT JOHN 18:37)
88
You say I am a king.  Actually I 
was born and came into the world to 
testify to the truth.  All who love 
the truth recognize that what I say 
is true.
PILATE
89
What is truth?
Jesus turns and looks him in the eyes.  A moment passes. Is 
Pilate seeing something he is afraid to question any further.  
Is he seeing something in himself he doesn't admit?  Whatever 
- the effect will be dismissive.  He turns away.

Do You not know that I have the 
power to crucify You -- and the 
power to release You?
CLOSE ON JESUS - who gazes up at Pilate, evenly replying:
JESUS
97
You could have no power at all

given you from above.  
Frustrated, Pilate strides past Jesus.
PILATE

Bring him outside.

world, over, mob) on the fingers and thumb of one hand.
JOY
116
A talking book took her back two 
thousand years and halfway around 
the world where she almost got run 
over by an angry mob!
(deadpan sarcasm)
Yeah, I'm sure she's fine with 
that.
ON CHRIS - who slumps, defeated.
CHRIS

Hm... You're right.  I'm doomed.

 Chris shuffles O.S. to face the music.
ANGLE AT COT - Chris steps over.  Phoebe looks up.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
118
Mom?  Can we talk for a sec?
Phoebe glances down at Mother Mary, still disconsolate.
GIZMO

Do not worry, Mrs. Quantum.  I will

keep an eye on her.
AT A WINDOW - Phoebe crosses over to Chris, who tries to look 
at her, then averts his eyes.
CHRIS
120
Mom, I just want to say -- I know 
this all really weird. And... just

... don't worry -- Superbook will 
get us out of here and take us 
home. I promise.  We'll be safe.
ANGLE PAST PHOEBE - who points to Mother Mary on the cot in 
B.G.  Phoebe speaks in a quiet voice.
PHOEBE
121
Chris.  Mary is about to lose her 
son -- the worst thing any mother 
could face.  I am not leaving her.
CLOSE ON CHRIS - Realizing that Phoebe misread his attempt at 
an apology as lack of concern for Mary, Chris sputters:
CHRIS
122
But Mom, that's not what I --
ANGLE FAVORING PHOEBE - cutting him off and eyeing him with 
disappointment.  They aren't connecting.
PHOEBE
123
This is exactly like your attitude 
back home, Chris.  Why don't you 
seem concerned about anybody but 
yourself?
Phoebe leaves Chris standing and returns to Mary's side.  
Chris protests, trying to keep his voice down.
CHRIS
124
Mom, I -- <frustrated groan>
Then Chris sees John by the door and crosses to him.

JOHN

It is out of our hands.  <sigh> 
Jesus knew this and was trying to 
make us understand.
(bows his head)
I just didn't grasp it... until 
today!
ON COT - Mother Mary suddenly looks up.  
MOTHER MARY
127
We must go.  It has begun.
ANGLE AT DOOR - John lifts away a CROSSBAR, then opens the 
door.  He escorts Mother Mary out.  Gizmo toddles after them.  
Phoebe starts to follow, pausing as Chris asks:
CHRIS
128
How does she know?
CLOSE ON PHOEBE - she replies, grim.
PHOEBE
129
She's His mother.
She exits.  ANGLE TO Joy and Chris, who trade troubled looks, 
then follow. 
CUT TO:
EXT. JERUSALEM - STREET - DAY
PULL BACK as Mother Mary and John hurry up a street; Phoebe, 
Joy, Chris and Gizmo follow.  Mary Magdalene rushes up and 
hugs John and then Mary.
MARY MAGDALENE (O.S.)
130
John!

At last, I found you!
The women hug.  John notices the Travelers puzzling at her.
JOHN

This is Mary Magdalene.  She is 
another friend of Jesus.

They've taken him to Golgotha.  We

MOB
134
(walla throughout)
ESTABLISHING a LIMESTONE HILL which resembles a skull.  A 
path leads up one side to the top -- where TWO CROSSES 
already stand.
OMINOUS MUSIC BUILDS as the death of Jesus unfolds IN QUICK 
CUTS and OBLIQUE ANGLES (to avoid overtly graphic images).  
Everything moves in slightly SLOW MOTION.
CUT TO:
SIDE ANGLE ON STEEP PATH - Jesus's bare feet shuffle uphill.  
As they GAIN OUT OF SHOT, the trailing end of the HEAVY 
WOODEN CROSS he carries plows a trough in the dirt.
CUT TO:
THE TWO THUGS - track Jesus as he goes by OFF-SCREEN.  As the 
ANGLED SHADOW OF CHRIST AND HIS CROSS passes over them, their 
sneers soften to looks of dismay.  One looks down and touches 
his own chest, as if something has changed within.
CUT TO:
HIGH DOWN ANGLE AT BASE OF HILL - One after the other, Mary 
Magdalene, Mother Mary, John, and then Phoebe, Chris, Joy and 
Gizmo hurry up the path following Jesus.
CUT TO:
ATOP THE HILL - The cross lands flat in the dirt, <THUD!>
CUT TO:
A SOLDIER'S HAND - pushes Jesus's arm down, holding it 
against the transverse beam of the cross.

 CLOSER - Another SOLDIER'S HAND moves INTO SHOT, holding a 
thick iron NAIL above Jesus's wrist.
CUT TO:
UP ANGLE - A HAMMER rises up IN SHOT.  As it swings DOWN AT 
CAMERA, FILLING FRAME -- 
CUT TO:
THE HAMMER - rises to strike a second blow.  As it falls --
CUT TO:
FAR SHOT OF CITY - THUNDER <RUMBLES> and LIGHTNING FLASHES 
across the storm-filled skies over Jerusalem.
CUT TO:
UP ANGLE FROM REAR - The cross tilts up into a vertical 
position and drops into a hole; Jesus hangs (facing away from 
CAMERA).  He is SILHOUETTED against a SLATE GREY SKY.
CUT TO:
DOWN ANGLE - PAN the faces of several ONLOOKERS (including 
the now-troubled Thugs, the Pharisee and Roman Soldier #1)... 
then SETTLE ON Satan, who stands off unnoticed.  Satisfied 
with his handiwork, he BLURS left to right and DISAPPEARS.
MONTAGE ENDS
AT TOP OF HILL - ACTION reverts to NORMAL SPEED and LIVE 
SOUND RESUMES.  <WIND WHISTLES> across the plateau.  Mary 
Magdalene, Mother Mary, and John gaze UP AT CAMERA in grief.
MEDIUM CLOSE - Chris, Joy, Gizmo and Phoebe they stare 
aghast.
CLOSE ON JESUS'S FACE - eyes at half-mast, wearing the crown 
of thorns.  CRANE UP TO ROMAN SOLDIER #1, standing on a 
LADDER, holding a hand-painted SIGN.
ROMAN SOLDIER #1
135
Pilate ordered that the sign he 
wrote be placed for all to see.
Roman Soldier #1 <HAMMERS> the SIGN into the post above 
Jesus's head. 
DOWN ANGLE ON GIZMO AND CHRIS - a short distance from the 
cross - Chris asides to the robot:

What does that sign say?
CLOSE ON GIZMO - as multiple TRANSLATIONS BLUR across his 
faceplate.  <Processing sfx>, They are in Hebrew, Greek and 
Latin.
GIZMO
137
(whispers)
It is Hebrew, Greek and Latin for 
'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the 
Jews.'
BACK ON CHRIS - His jaw drops open and he gapes at Jesus on 
the cross.
CLOSE ON JESUS
JESUS (NKJV LUKE 23:34)

Father, forgive them for they do 
not know what they do.
DOWN SHOT ON MOTHER MARY AND JOHN - JUST BELOW - as John

No... no...
CLOSE ON JESUS -  Despite his pain, he manages to rasp:
JESUS (NKJV JOHN 19:26)
140
Woman, behold your Son.
CLOSE ON CHRIS - as he registers this.
BACK ON JESUS - He looks slightly to one side and adds:
JESUS (CONT’D)
141
John.  Behold your mother!
DOWN SHOT ON JOHN - He nods, heartbroken but determined.
ANGLE ON CHRIS - He looks to his own mother who now has her 
arm around Mary Magdalen - consoling her.  Both women stand 
with heads bowed in sorrow.
BACK ON CHRIS - Push in on his recognition of the challenge 
Jesus is making for him.

TWO SHOT - Chris and Phoebe, moved to tears, stare up at 
Jesus. Chris sidles towards him mother. 
CAMERA DROPS TO THEIR HANDS - they reach out and gasp one 
another's hand tightly. 
CLOSE ON JESUS - he shudders as a wave of pain washes over 
him.
135A JESUS (NLT JOHN 19:28)
143
(breathing effort) I am thirsty!
ON THUG #1 and THUG #2 - who glower at the Temple Priest.
Soldier #2 and Soldier #1.
SOLDIER #2

Give him water.
Roman Soldier #1 holds up a WINE-SACK CANTEEN and shrugs.
ROMAN SOLDIER #1
145
I got some sour wine.
Soldier #1 pours the CRIMSON CONTENTS of his canteen on a 
HUNK OF SPONGE.
ON JESUS - as the DRIPPING SPONGE rises up to his lips on a 
PIKE.  Jesus turn his head and it bows, as he gives up the 
Spirit.
JESUS (NKJV JOHN 19:30)
146
It is finished.
His eyes close.
DOWN ANGLE - Two groups - John and Mary beneath the cross.  
Chris, Joy, Gizmo, Mary Madeline, Phoebe and all the others a 
short distance away from the base of the cross  - No one 
moves.  The only sound is the <WIND>.  Then, Mother Mary 
falls to her knees, shattered.

WIDEN TO INCLUDE Chris, who speaks to Phoebe in a whisper:

doesn't Superbook take us home?
ANGLE ON - Gizmo looks up and shrugs innocently.

WHITE DOVES perch on the roof and the branches of a nearby 
olive tree.  Her LAMP'S FEEBLE LIGHT shows the HUGE STONE 
which blocked the entrance resting nearby.  Mary Magdalene 
warily approaches.  Disturbed, the DOVES lift off and FLUTTER

 There are two ANGELS in white sitting -- one at the head and 
the other at the feet -- where the body of Jesus had lain.
ANGEL
158
Woman, why are you weeping?
ANGLE ON MARY MAGDALENE - framed in the tomb's portal.  Tears 
stream down her face.
MARY MAGDALENE (NLT JOHN 20:2)

(weeping) They have taken the 
Lord's body out of the tomb, and we 
don't know where they have put him!
She doesn't notice as a LIGHT BEGINS TO SHINE BEHIND HER.

Why are you crying?  Who are you 
looking for?
Mary Magdalene turns.
CUT TO:
EXT. JOSEPH'S TOMB - CONTINUOUS - BEFORE DAWN
Mary Magdalene, standing in the door to the tomb, stares up 
PAST CAMERA.  We do not yet see whom she is addressing as she 
tries to peer into that WHITE LIGHT.
MARY MAGDALENE (NLT JOHN 20:15)
161
If you have taken him away, tell me 
where you have put him, and I will
