SYNOPSIS: Chris has a dream about Jason, the boy that broke into 
the Quantum home last season. Joy thinks that the dream might be a 
prompting by God for Chris to help Jason; Chris never followed up 
with Jason after they forgave him for the break-in, and they 
recently saw him hanging out with a some bad influences. Chris 
dismisses Joy's interpretation, feeling that he is too young to be 
called by God. Superbook takes them to meet Young Samuel, right at 
a time when Eli's sons are having a negative influence on the 
nation of Israel. Chris and Joy witness Samuel being called by God 
as a young boy in Eli's service. Years later, after Samuel is 
grown, they see the fulfillment of God's calling, as Samuel leads 
the people back to God, and the Lord saves the people from a 
Philistine onslaught. Back in the present, Chris acts on his 
calling, and makes an attempt to befriend Jason.
TAKE-AWAY:  You're never too young to be called into God's service.

FADE IN:
INT. NIGHTMARE - NIGHT
Eerie MUSIC plays as a door floats in a black void - no walls 
or floor visible, just the floating door.
<SMASH> A rock crashes through a window pane on the door. 
CLOSE ON THE ROCK as it rolls to a stop.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL CHRIS sitting, legs pulled up to his 
chest, the rock at his foot. Chris shivers with fear.
ANGLE ON THE DOOR slowly opening with a <CREAK>. 
A <BOOM> of thunder, as a LIGHTNING FLASH REVEALS JASON 
DUNNING (the boy who broke into the Quantum house in episode 
112) standing in the door way. 
CLOSE ON CHRIS, his eyes widen with fear.
ANGLE ON THE DOOR. Jason creeps in. He is crouched over, 
hands reaching out, his hands like claws.
JASON

TWO SHOT Jason approaches the cowering Chris. As Jason gets 
closer, Chris shrinks back.

(continues his scream)
WIDER ON THE ROOM. JOY stands in front of Chris, her fingers 
in her ears. Chris is calm.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
5
So I screamed like that, and then 
woke up. Weird, right? Joy?
Chris reaches over and pulls Joy’s arms away, pulling her 
fingers out of her ears.
JOY
6
Are you done screaming?
GIZMO zooms into frame.
GIZMO

Oooh, a dream!  May I interpret it, 
please, may I, may I?

 JOY
8
Since when do you interpret dreams, 
Gizmo?
GIZMO
9
I installed a new software package - 
“dream interpretation and the art 
of robot maintenance.” 
TWO SHOT as Gizmo pushes in, face to face with Chris.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
10
Now, Chris, your dream means that 
you are afraid that your retro 
conductors are short circuiting, 
and that you need a new plasma 
interface board!
ON JOY 
She frowns.
JOY
11
Giz, Chris isn’t a robot.
THREE SHOT
GIZMO
12
Oh, right. Sorry, can’t help you 
then.
CHRIS
13
Aw... my dream probably doesn’t 
mean anything anyway.
CLOSE ON JOY
JOY
14
I wouldn’t be so sure. I mean, You 
dreamed about Jason, the kid who 
broke into your house. And we just 
saw him, so it’s logical he’d be on 
your mind.
FAVOR GIZMO
He is suddenly interested and moves closer to Chris and JOy
GIZMO

You have seen Jason?

He was hanging out with that bully, 
Pearce, and his crew at the skate 
park.
GIZMO
17
Those kids are bad news. 
FAVOR CHRIS as he turns away.
JOY
18
Chris, after your forgave Jason for 
breaking in, you told him you were 
going to be his friend. But you 
never... I don’t know... 
CHRIS
19
What?
ANGLE ON JOY
JOY
20
(carefully)
Maybe your dream is... maybe 
something’s telling you you’re 
supposed to make friends with 
him... before something happens to 
him again.  
CHRIS
21
That crazy.  Dream don’t tell you 
things, Joy.  And if they did, then 
that dream I had was telling me to 
stay of mist filled places with  
floating doors or something.
<THE SUPERBOOK SFX> suddenly can be heard. 
27
CHRIS / JOY 
22
Superbook!
SUPERBOOK appears in the lab in front of the kids.

WIPE TO:
INT. TEMPLE AT SHILOH - NEAR THE ALTAR - DAY
A CROWD of people along with sheep and goats mill around the 
courtyard. A flash of BLUE LIGHT behind some of the sheep.
CROWD 
25
(general walla)
CAMERA TRAVELS THROUGH THE SHEEP
To the corner of the courtyard; there among some sheep sits 
Chris, Joy and Gizmo.
CHRIS
26
Sheep?  What kind of hero will we 
find in a sheep stall?
ON GIZMO
A map of the temple is reflected in his faceplate.
GIZMO
27
My sensors indicate we are not in a 
sheep stall, Chris, but the 
tabernacle in Shiloh.
ON THE SHEEP as Chris, Joy and Gizmo slowly rise up to look 
over the sheep.
POV
Camera PANS over the livestock to the crowd lined up at the 
blazing altar; beyond that to the lavar, and on to the walls 
of the Holy Place. They take in the hustle and bustle of the 
crowds.
BACK ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO as they sink back down behind 
the sheep.
THREE SHOT
JOY

Maybe we should something to help 
us blend in around here

 ANGLE ON GIZMO. A woolly SHEEP nuzzles up to Gizmo. Gizmo 
smiles as an idea comes to him. He pulls out an electric 
shaver.
GIZMO
29
Hold still, little lamb!
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY. They cringe in reaction to the 
<BUZZING> sound.
BACK ON GIZMO AND THE SHEEP. The sheep is now completely 
shorn, a pile of wool sits on the ground. <BAAAA>
Gizmo pulls out a set of knitting needles. His hands move 
over the pile of wool in a BLUR, going faster and faster to a 
<CLICKING WHIR SOUND>.
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY. The two share a look. 
A robe flies into frame, landing on Chris. Another robe flies 
out and lands on Joy. 
ANGLE ON GIZMO AND THE SHEEP, Gizmo now dressed in period 
costume. Gizmo holds a scarf in his hand.
GIZMO (CONT’D)
30
And enough left over for you, 
little fella.
Gizmo wraps the scarf around the sheep’s neck. <BAAAAA>
AT THE ALTAR
ABDEEL, (E.Z. - NAME CHANGE TO COME WITH APPROVAL) a servant 
to the priests, argues with MACHI, a man standing with his 
sheep near the altar as the CROWD looks on.
ABDEEL
31
I must take your sheep now. It is 
the will of the priests!
MACHI
32
(angry)
But my sheep must be offered to God 
before the priests take their 
share. That is the law of God!
TWO SHOT ON ABDEEL AS HE LEANS INTO MACHI
ABDEEL
33
The priests want the best of the 
meat before it is offered. Do I 
need to take it from you by force?

 ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY
JOY
34
If they keep that up there’s going 
to be a riot!
The crowd pushes in on the kids. Joy is knocked to the 
ground.
JOY (CONT’D)
35
(falling efforts)
YOUNG SAMUEL, a servant boy in a blue robe over a linen 
ephod, moves into frame, and helps Joy up. Young Samuel yells 
at the crowd.
E.Z. NOTE: No one was allowed INSIDE the tabernacle except 
the priests. (NEED TO DISCUSS STAGING)
YOUNG SAMUEL
36
Everyone, please, stop!
BACK TO THE ALTAR
The crowd parts to make way for Young Samuel.
MACHI
37
Samuel, this man means to take my 
offering before it is placed on the 
altar. Surely, the high priest does 
not approve?
Young Samuel looks to Abdeel, then back to Machi.
YOUNG SAMUEL
38
Machi, the priests have authority 
in this matter. Give your offering 
over - if they abuse the offering, 
it will be on their heads.
PHINEHAS (O.S.)
39
Listen to the boy.
E.Z. NOTE TO BE DISCUSSED - Doctrinal question for someone 
higher than me: This is a fictional scenario. Would Samuel 
have allowed the priests to desecrate the sacrifice or would 
he have instead submitted to the holiness of God's law and 
stood up to them?
Samuel and Machi turn to see:
ANGLE ON PHINEHAS AND HOPHNI dressed in simple white priestly 
robes, looking haughtily on the scene. Each one has WOMEN 
standing slightly behind them.

Unless we need to have you escorted 
away to calm this outburst.
ANGLE ON YOUNG SAMUEL, ABDEEL AND MACHI
MACHI
41
You are supposed to be priests of 
the Lord God. How can you-
Hophni leans in, menacing.
MACHI (CONT’D)
42
No, wait!... Take the offering.
WIDE ON THE SCENE
As Abdeel pulls Machi’s sheep away from the man.
PHINEHAS
43
Excellent choice. Anyone else have 
a problem? Good. Ladies?
Phinehas and Machi turn, along with their companions. Hophni 
turns back.
ANGLE ON HOPHNI
HOPHNI
44
Samuel, shouldn’t you be attending 
to my father?
He turns away and walks on.
ON THE SCENE, FAVORING YOUNG SAMUEL
He doesn’t answer, but scowls towards the exiting priests.
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY
JOY
45
Do you think that boy is who 
Superbook wants us to meet?  
Joy walks out of frame.
CHRIS
46
Nah. Superbook said it would be 
someone called by God. He’s a kid.

 JOY
47
Hi.  That was pretty cool, what you 
did. Stepping into that fight to 
calm them down. - I’m Joy. This is 
Chris.
YOUNG SAMUEL
48
I am Samuel, a servant to the High 
Priest, Eli.
CHRIS
49
You work for the high priest?  Wow! 
how’d you get that job? 
ANGLE ON YOUNG SAMUEL. He shrugs. 
YOUNG SAMUEL
50
I have always been in his service.  
It was my mother, Hannah.. she 
never have children and was so 
upset...
ON THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOLY PLACE
The crowd mills about the doors.
YOUNG SAMUEL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
51
One night, she came to this very 
spot to pray to God, and beg him to 
give her a child.
The image of the entrance CROSS FADES TO:
EXT. THE TABERNACLE - SHILOH - NIGHT
(NOTE: CHECK STAGING DURING NOTES) HANNAH stands to the side, 
facing the Holy Place. On the other side of the entrance, ELI 
sits on a stool, deep in the shadows.
The scene plays out MOS, soft <MUSIC> under. Hannah sways as 
she prays.
YOUNG SAMUEL (V.O.)
52
She told the Lord that if he gave 
her a son, she would dedicate the 
boy into the Lord’s service.
Eli rises from his stool and moves towards Hannah. Hannah 
turns to Eli, and falls on her knees in front of him.
YOUNG SAMUEL
53
Eli happened to be sitting nearby.

ELI
54
Go in peace, and the God of Israel 
grant your petition which you have 
asked of Him.
The image CROSS FADES TO:
EXT. TABERNACLE - SHILOH - DAY
Back to the present, daylight and crowd milling about. Music 
is replaced by general sound of the crowds.
ANGLE ON YOUNG SAMUEL, CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
JOY
55
(putting it together)
And... you’re that son?
Samuel nods.
YOUNG SAMUEL
56
Shortly after I was born, I was 
brought here and dedicated to the 
Lord’s service. I have been with 
Eli ever since.
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND JOY
CHRIS
57
(sotto voce - to Joy)
Do you think Eli is the powerful 
man Superbook wants us to meet?
JOY
58
I think it’s him. Samuel.
CHRIS
59
No way.
(back to Young Samuel)
So, what was that fight all about?
THREE SHOT 
YOUNG SAMUEL
60
The two priests you saw are Eli’s 
sons. The priests are supposed to 
receive a portion of any sacrifice 
after it has been offered to God.
JOY
61
And they wanted it before?

 YOUNG SAMUEL
62
Yes, they wanted the better part. 
It is an offense to God. Eli 
disapproves, but he cannot control 
his sons. - Tell me, why are you 
have come here?
They share a look.
JOY
63
Uh... The three of us are here to 
... serve as well.
YOUNG SAMUEL
64
The three of you?
CHRIS
65
Yes. Me. Joy and Gizmo.
YOUNG SAMUEL
66
Who is Gizmo?
Chris and Joy look around.
ANGLE ON GIZMO
Sitting among the sheep, knitting. Several of the sheep now 
sport scarves around their necks. The shorn sheep stands next 
to Gizmo.
GIZMO
67
My new friends all wanted scarves. 
Don’t they look great?
ON YOUNG SAMUEL, CHRIS AND JOY
They look to each other, and shrug.
CHRIS

That’s Gizmo.

 INT. ELI’S QUARTERS - SERVING AREA - DAY
A small room, with a table containing pitchers and cups. A 
curtain hangs separating this room from Eli’s sitting room. 
Mats for sleeping are piled up against a wall.
Young Samuel shows Chris, Joy and Gizmo the cups.
YOUNG SAMUEL
69
When Eli holds meetings, it is our 
job to bring them drinks. You’ll 
find... Wait. I believe he is in 
there now.
Young Samuel moves to the curtain.
INT. ELI’S QUARTERS - MAIN AREA - DAY
Young Samuel peeks through the curtain. Chris, Joy and 
Gizmo’s heads also pop out of the curtain.
REVERSE ANGLE
It is a simple room - bed in the corner, three chairs in a 
circle. ELI stands facing Hophni and Phinehas.  Eli is now a 
rotund man, weak of character.
He wears a basic linen tunic. His formal priestly robes and 
ephod are draped on a stand behind him.
ELI
70
I am shamed when I hear of such 
things!
REVERSE ANGLE Young Samuel and the others pull away from the 
curtain, back into the other room.

YOUNG SAMUEL

He is with his sons. These meetings 
never end well. Please, take these

serving trays)  
ELI
72
The offerings are meant for God!
ANGLE ON PHINEHAS AND HOPHNI
Gizmo comes to one side, offering a cup to Phinehas; Joy 
comes up on the other side with a cup for Hophni.
Hophni takes his cup and drinks greedily as Phinehas talks.
PHINEHAS
73
Come now, father. God gets his 
share. Eventually.
HOPHNI
74
(brief-low belching noise - then)
So what is the harm?
(E.Z. NOTED belching might be too much. Let’s discuss)
Phinehas grabs his own cup and drinks.
WIDE ON SCENE 
Eli still hasn’t taken his cup.
ELI
75
It undermines my authority, and it 
undermines the respect for the 
temple. (IS THIS A CORRECT REF?)
HOPHNI
76
You don’t complain when your 
portion of the offerings comes in.
ELI
77
That’s not... I’m not... And the 
women. Must you be so public?
ANGLE ON PHINEHAS AND HOPHNI
PHINEHAS
78
We work hard for the people, and so 
we play hard. If anyone has a 
complaint about that, he can say it 
to my face!

Men have prophesied to me, saying 
that because I let you dishonor the 
Lord, he is going to take both of 
your lives on the same day! 
PHINEHAS
80
No one likes a gloomy prophet.  
(yawn) I need some entertainment. 
Come, brother.
Phinehas and Hophni, turn hand Chris and Joy their cups and 
march out of the room.
ON ELI. He sinks into his chair. Chris, still holding the 
drink, turns and moves out of frame.
ON THE DOORWAY TO THE SERVING AREA
Young Samuel holds open the curtain as Joy and Gizmo return 
Samuel takes the full cup from Chris and steps main into the 
room.  Young Samuel carries the cup to the sagging man.
YOUNG SAMUEL
81
Please. Drink something. It will 
make you feel better.
Eli looks up, and puts his hand on Young Samuel’s cheek.
ELI
82
Samuel. You are so good to me, and 
so good to our God. If only-
Eli sags again. Young Samuel takes the cup, and puts it into 
Eli’s hand. 
Eli drinks.

Chris, Joy and Gizmo look out onto the scene.
Chris and Joy share a concerned look.

room.
The trio make their way to the curtain and look out.

It wasn’t Eli calling him?
Gizmo shrugs.

Son, I believe that you may be

They all pull back behind the curtain.

We heard the voice last night. Are 
you going to tell Eli?
Young Samuel stops sweeping.

How can I?

GOD (O.S.)

At that time I will carry out 
against Eli everything I spoke 
against his family—from beginning 
to end. 
YOUNG SAMUEL (V.O.)

He told me it was because you knew 
of the sins of your sons, and you 
did nothing to restrain them.

Eli puts his hand on Young Samuel’s shoulder, trying to 
steady himself. He staggers.
YOUNG SAMUEL
118
Eli?
ELI
119
He is the Lord. Let him do what is 
good in his eyes. 
Eli leans on Young Samuel, as they head off.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
JOY
120
He... he accepted it. The prophecy 
against him and his sons - he just 
accepted it.
GIZMO
121
I was certain he would be angry. We 
must ask Samuel -
Suddenly, the SUPERBOOK EFFECT SHIMMERS.
CHRIS & JOY & GIZMO
122
Whoaaa...
CHRIS
123
Where’s Superbook taking us 
nooooww.
They DISAPPEAR into the shimmering light.

The kids float as they are surrounded by the whirl of the 
Superbook effect. As Superbook speaks, images appear on the 
walls of the shimmer, like a holographic movie being 
projected onto a screen.
The ROAR OF WIND prevents any sound from the images coming 
across distinctly.
Images of battle fill the screen, as PHILISTINE and ISRAELITE 
ARMIES clash. WE NEED TO SEE THE ISRAELITES CARRYING THE ARK 
OF THE COVENANT INTO THE HEAT OF BATTLE. (POSSIBLE REUSE 
SOLDIERS FROM 106 - CHECK HISTORICAL ACCURACY)

The Lord fulfilled his prophesy, as 
the Philistines won a battle 
against the people of Israel. Eli’s 
sons both died that day.
CLOSE ON THE BATTLE
Hophni and Phinehas in the midst of the battle. Two 
PHILISTINES approach them, swords drawn. Both Hophni and 
Phinehas shrink back in fear.
PHINEHAS & HOPHNI

WIDE ON THE KIDS FLOATING IN THE TIME TRAVEL VORTEX (NOT THE 
STANDARD SB TUNNEL)
The battle images fade, replaced by Eli, older and fatter, 
sitting on his stool in the temple. A MESSENGER runs up - a 
soldier in ragged clothing.
SUPERBOOK (V.O.)

When Eli heard the news, he fell 
over dead in shock.
Eli falls back as the image fades, replaced by the image of 
Philistine Army marching.

TO:
INT. SAMUEL’S TENT - DAY
Several large urns stand near a wall, surrounded by smaller 
jugs - a camp’s water supply. A blue light flashes behind the 
urns.
Chris, Joy and Gizmo peek out from behind the urns.
REVERSE ANGLE ON SAMUEL, now an adult, kneels in the middle 
of the tent, arms wide, face turned up to the ceiling - same 
pose as Young Samuel listening to God’s voice. Samuel’s eyes 
are closed, he is turned away from our trio.
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
GIZMO
129
I know who that is. Watch.
Gizmo projects a hologram of Young Samuel in his prayerful 
pose right in front of the grown Samuel. The young image 
morphs and ages until he looks identical to Samuel.
JOY
130
(hushed)
We’ve jumped through time again. 
He’s grown up!
ANGLE ON ADULT SAMUEL. His eyes open.
ADULT SAMUEL
131
Sorry, I didn’t hear you come in. 
WIDE ON THE SCENE.  
Chris, Joy and Gizmo step out from behind the urn.
ADULT SAMUEL (CONT’D)
132
I am ready. Please, fill that jar 
with water.
Chris crosses and fills the jar as directed.

The people have been led astray, 
and now the armies of the 
Philistines are approaching.
CHRIS
134
If you know... how come you aren’t 
doing anything about it?
SAMUEL
135
I am doing the only thing that can 
save our people. The water please.
Joy and Gizmo move away from Chris.
Chris picks up a jar, and scoops it into the water in the 
urn.
TWO SHOT ON SAMUEL AND JOY
JOY
136
What can you do?
SAMUEL
137
Me? Nothing, except set the 
example. Our people need to turn 
back to God. The Lord called me as 
a child, and has watched over me 
all my life. He has brought me to 
this moment. Trust in him.
Samuel walks to the door. Chris moves into frame with the 
jug. He looks at Joy and Gizmo. They follow Samuel.
EXT. PLAINS OF MIZPAH - DAY
Samuel exits the tent, Chris, Joy and Gizmo on his heels. 
They stop just outside the tent.
JOY
138
Whoa.
WIDE ON THE CAMP. The area immediately around Samuel’s tent 
is crowded with MEN AND WOMEN dressed in sack cloth, covered 
in ashes, faces to the ground.
CROWD

An altar sits in the midst of the people.

 SAMUEL

The people have followed me out 
into the plains, repenting before 
God. The water, please.
Chris hand him the jug.
WIDE as Samuel strides into the midst of the crowd. He lifts 
the jug high into the sky.
ANGLE FROM OVER THE SHOULDERS OF Chris, Joy and Gizmo, still 
at the tent. Samuel can be seen over their shoulders.
GIZMO
141
I believe this is a ceremony of 
repentance. He pours water out, 
then will follow with an offering.
WIDE ON THE CAMP. A MESSENGER races through the people up to 
Samuel. The people around him look up.
ANGLE ON SAMUEL AND THE MESSENGER
MESSENGER
142
Samuel, the Philistines are 
approaching! They heard we were 
gathered here, and are on their way 
to annihilate us!
CROWD
143
(worried murmur)
SAMUEL
144
Everyone please remain calm. We 
will continue to pray, and to offer 
a sacrifice to God.
MESSENGER
145
But we only have a small number of 
soldiers out here. We can’t protect 
you!
SAMUEL
146
God will protect us.
WIDE as the people return to their poses of repentance.
Samuel raises his arms in prayer.

how many Philistines are on their 
way?
CLOSE ON GIZMO. Goggles pop onto his head, <WHIRRING>.
FROM GIZMO’S POV - THE PLAIN OF MIZPAH
ZOOM to an infrared view of an approaching army. Numbers 
flash across the screen.
GIZMO
148
They have the Israelite army 
outnumbered ten to one!
ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
JOY
149
They will kill everyone! We should 
run!
ON THE APPROACHING PHILISTINE ARMY. A horde of PHILISTINES, 
marching, looks of determination on their faces.
ON THE ISRAELITE ARMY. A row of a dozen SOLDIERS, look out, 
fear on their faces.
ANGLE ON SAMUEL’S ALTAR 
SAMUEL laying a lamb across the altar.  Chris and Joy rush up 
to him.
CHRIS
150
Samuel, we have to leave!
JOY
151
We can’t win against them! Gizmo?
Gizmo pushes into the frame between Joy and Chris.
GIZMO
152
The odds of surviving are 
astronomically small.
Chris and Joy simultaneously point at Gizmo with forefingers 
pointed outstretched and thumbs cocked upwards.
CHRIS & JOY
153
Trust him.

He smiles.

He looks to the sky.
ON THE PHILISTINE ARMY. The marching force lower their 
spears.
ON THE ISRAELITE ARMY. The men grimace, lower their spears, 
and await the onslaught.
ON THE ALTAR - LOW ANGLE - flames and smoke rising to Heaven.  
(Do not show the lamb burning.)
EXTREME HIGH OVERVIEW THE BATTLEFIELD
The Philistine army races towards the smaller Israelite 
force, closing the ground quickly.

BOOM! Thunder shakes the clouds as lightning dashes across 
the sky.
ON THE PHILISTINES
<BOOM> The soldiers slow in their run, shaken by the noise.
<BOOM> Some turn back, others look to the skies.
<BOOM> A few soldiers fall to their knees.
ANGLE ON THE ISRAELITE ARMY 
The Israelite soldiers look to each other in wonder.

They charge.
OVER VIEW OF THE BATTLEFIELD
The smaller band of Israelite soldiers race headlong towards 
the Philistines, who either fall at the attack or turn and 
run away.
WIDE ON THE ALTAR AREA
The people surrounding Samuel and the altar push into Samuel, 
rejoicing.
CROWD
157

ANGLE ON CHRIS, JOY AND GIZMO
Chris is stunned. 
CHRIS
158
I don’t believe it.
Samuel notices the kids standing in disbelief. He moves from 
the group and over to them.
SAMUEL 
159
Believe it, Chris.
TWO SHOT ON SAMUEL AND CHRIS
Samuel squats down in front of Chris.
SAMUEL (CONT’D)
160
God called me when I was younger 
than you are now.  He watched over 
me, every step of the way. All 
things are possible if you listen 
and answer His call.
He rises and returns the group.  Joy and Gizmo approach 
Chris, who seems lost in thought.
GIZMO
161
What did he say, Chris?

call.
Gizmo whips out a cell phone.
GIZMO
163
Excellent!  I make sure I put God 
on your speed dial.  
(holding out the phone)
Uh... do you have his number? 
Chris takes the phone and shuts it off.
CHRIS
164
He wasn’t talking about that kind 
of “call,” Giz.
Chris hands him back the phone.  Gizmo looks at it for a 
beat.
GIZMO
165
I do not understand. 
Joy looks at Chris.
JOY
166
But you do... don’t you?  
Chris nods thoughtfully.
CHRIS
167
My dream about Jason.
He looks over at Samuel and then exits O.C.  Joy follows.  
Gizmo stands with a miffed expression.
GIZMO
168
Okay, may I say I am thoroughly 
confused.  Chris... Joy!
He heads off after them.

In the back of the crowd, behind all the people, smiling. 
CHRIS

Samuel was a just a boy when God 
started speaking to him...

And because he listened, look what 
he was able to do. 
At that moment, THE SUPERBOOK SFX COMES UP.

(All skaters wear proper safety equipment) - Jason saunters 
to the edge carrying his skateboard. He looks down into the 
pipe. PEARCE and SKATEBOARD PUNK #1 (from episode 209) hang 
nearby.  There should be other SKATEBOARD KIDS coming and 
going (IMPORTANT NOTE: In an effort to make this overall 
scene more ethnically diverse please do NOT us any Caucasian 
kids as BG skaters.)  
SKATEBOARD PUNK #1

Pearce calls to Jason.

Jason watches as Pearce heads down the bowl backwards.

Nothin’ really.  I was just

But... that didn’t make us friends.
Jason turns away and adjusts the strap on his helmet, 
prepping to make a run.
CHRIS

Chris steps up to the lip beside Jason.  He tightens the 
strap on his own helmet.

You ever do a three-sixty pop?
ANGLE ON JASON as he stops. He turns his head back toward 
Chris.
JASON

But not without falling flat on my 
butt.

I know a trick that keeps the board 
from flipping. 
Jason looks at Chris, then back towards the skater boys.Then 
back to Chris.
JASON
189
Show me. And don’t think this makes 
us friends.

Holds it to his ear... shakes it again... punches through the

Are you sure?  Because it never 
rang?  It could have been on

And even when I check the log it 
does not say God called.
